Some were too \n        peculiar for anything, for instance the Duke of Bedford's had one flat \n        bow and a flower on it, he took just 25 minutes over the bow and as long \n        over the flower and when it was finished the effect was like a hay rick \n        with all the hay scraped from off it!!

In the evening we \n        all played pool at which I am no good whatever, therefore I am afraid \n        I have no great affection for!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>December 31st</b></i><br/>\n        In the morning we did nothing special but in the evening we played pool \n        and danced till about 10.30 and this being New Year's Eve we of course \n        had Snap Dragon and sat the old year out. At 10.30 it was ready, we all \n        assembled in the dining room, heated then lit the brandy and put the lights \n        out, then set to work to pick the almonds and raisins out, it was such \n        fun especially as we didn't burn ourselves very much. When it was all \n        over we decided to go out and listen to the bells and leave all the door \n        open so as to let the New Year in. The night was lovely and warm. We then \n        sang Auld Lang Syne with crossed swinging hands and afterwards returned \n        to the dining room where we smoked cigarettes and drank the healths of \n        all our friends until 1 o'clock when we turned in for bed...so we thought. \n        I must mention here that whilst the men were having their first smoke \n        we went to their rooms and filled the rooms with practical jokes. We gave \n        them each an apple pie (<span>ie: folded the bed sheet \n        and tucked it in so that the occupant discovered they could not get into \n        the bed</span>), holly, sewed Elliot's pyjamas up in 600 places and hid \n        his shaving brush. So far, so good. When we had retired to bed we thought \n        we would leave our doors ajar so as to hear how our jokes went on, but \n        unfortunately by some accident they both found out and as soon as E had \n        done so he came tearing up the stairs and I had just got into my nighty \n        when he burst in, in spite of my having bolted the door, caught hold of \n        a corner of our bedclothes, pulled them all off and rushed down the stairs \n        with the whole lot. I in my shortest nightgown flew after him and just \n        as I reached the drawing room out came Walter, I in terror hid until Yso \n        brought me my dressing gown, in the meantime Elliot flew upstairs and \n        did exactly the same to Yso and Miss S while we went to Walter's room, \n        pulled all his clothes off and blew our his candle and bagged his matches!!<br/>\n        It was a joke!! One thing dreadful which happened, W came to our room \n        to get our matches and the whole place was littered with our underclothes \n        of all sorts, but worst of all (<span>code</span>: \n        \" under the bed there gleamed the butler's eye!!!!\" <span>This \n        must be a shocked reference to a chamberpot!</span>). I nearly had a fit \n        not knowing what to do. However W went out seeing I believe my embarrassment! \n        We then got one of Eva's bed socks, hung it on a nail outside the door \n        and filled it with a boot, soap etc as an Xmas present from W to E!! Yso \n        and I then went down to see how Elliot was getting on and found him making \n        his bed whilst Eva was slaving at his pyjamas. We finished the evening \n        by making our beds again and W's , getting to sleep at about 2.30. They \n        say they are determined to pay us out but we are prepared and have locked \n        our doors, however if Elliot bursts through them again like he did it \n        wont be much use!! </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}}, "errors": [], "description": "\n\n\n<p>\n\n\n</p>\n<p><span>Wynne started keeping her diary \n              in November . </span></p>\n<p>The family now prepare for Christmas at their home, Brookfield, \n              in Dorset. </p>\n\n\n"}, "november": {"viewers": {"viewer_1": {"order": 1, "title": "Viewer 1", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1895/november/Front_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><b><span>This is the first \n        page from the first diary Wynne kept - the drawing at the top is of the \n        family home, Brookfield, in Tarrant Keyneston.

He certainly isn't a bit like what Ray describes him as but he only stayed about 3 days so we couldn't see much of him.

After tea he came with us down to the schoolroom and helped us to decorate it.  He worked like a galley slave and was so good about it whilst Bill and I employed our time by using his legs as pin cushions which he didn't seem to appreciate!

Our duets went off very well and Eva and I went encore 3 times in our costume song.  The people simply shrieked with joy, in fact everybody said they enjoyed it very much.

All the morning we lazed about and in the afternoon we took a fly and went up to see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saalburg\">Saalburg</a>, a Roman Camp of large dimensions. We had tea up there and then drove home.  Its about 5 miles away and we took just an hour and a half getting there.  True it was rather up hill a good bit of the way but even on the level road the horse insisted on walking!! and in spite of the abuse we hurled at the driver he took absolutely no notice whatever and continued to meander along.  Considering the language we used was half Hindostan, Italian and German I don't blame him because I'm sure he couldn't have understood one word.  The Camp is very interesting and very large, its on the top of a hill and has five huge wells which contained all the treasure which they found.

I don't know when I hated anything so much.  I do dislike leaving all my nice friends whom I haven't the slightest chance of seeing again.  Last night Arthur Rose gave me such a neat watch bracelet of Russia leather, as mine was broken.  I do think it was sweet of him.  He also had put in my room an anonymous box of chocolates, how charming some people can be when they choose. Neither Arthur or Dr Caverhill could see us off as they had to go to church!  Or rather the latter had and so dragged off the former too.  Old Mr Rose came to see us off and brought me a huge box of fondons <span>(sic)</span> and roses, amongst other people Mrs Kennedy gave me such a sweet little bouquet. Everyone was so kind to me no wonder I hated leaving. We arrived at Wiesbaden where Auntie and Algie met us and drove us first to the \"Block\" where we deposited our luggage then drove on up to the Schon Aussicht.  The children were all flourishing and I got Auntie to give me a photo of my precious Bill. <span>(This is Bill Fallowfield -<a href=\"http://www.wynnesdiary.com/1915_pages/september/viewer_10.html\"> he died</a> in WW1).</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>August 17th</em></strong><br/>\n        Went shopping with Mopsel after which I left her to go and see the children whilst she went to meet Uncle Hugh at the station.  He wasn't looking at all well.  I played with the children until I thought I should have a fit from running and laughing.  We left about mid day for Heidelberg. </p>\n<p><strong><em>August 18th</em></strong><br/>\n        This as everyone knows is a beautiful place.  After we arrived we took a drive along the river (Neckar) round by Wolfsbrunnen and the Castle.  The scenery is just too lovely for words. The river runs between two high chains of mountains and all over the place there are little villages dotted about.  Wolfsbrunnen is a quaint little place chiefly used for trout fishing and as for the Castle I should have liked to roam about it for hours.  It is a dull red colour and all in ruins.  We saw there the largest cask in the world, it holds 300,000 bottles of wine and the story goes that (cant remember his name) was making it he used to drink from 18-20 bottles every day!!  I bought at the hotel some photos of it for my collection. Whilst we were driving to the Castle a little girl ran up and gave me a little bunch of flowers for which we gave her a trifle, but I lost the flowers more's the pity.</p>\n<p><strong><em>August 19th</em></strong><br/>\n        Today we left Heidelberg for Freiberg and a more decayed hole I have never been at.  The only object of interest here is an old Roman Catholic Minster, very old and interesting but the place itself is (not) and I was glad enough to leave the next day for<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titisee\"> Titisee</a>.  Today is Ell's birthday and we drank his health. </p>\n<p><strong><em>August 20th</em></strong><br/>\n        Never have I seen such beautiful scenery than I did today coming up in the train.  It was very fine weather and as we had to go very slowly because of the uphill way we had plenty of time to look about.  The mountains are simply huge on either side and on one side of the line there runs a river which is simply sweet and makes a tremens noise.  The scenery reminded me very much of Scotland only of course here the mountains are covered with firs.  This place Titisee is on a plateau and in front of our hotel is a lovely lake 3 miles long and 2 wide.  After lunch Father and I went for a walk round the lake and I suppose I must have got my feet wet or something as ever since I have had a beastly cold.  I went to a little shop here and bought two little Swiss chateaux and some tiny carved wooden animals for my collection. </p>\n<p><strong><em>August 21st</em></strong><br/>\n        Spent the day in reading and writing letters as it poured without ceasing all day long.  This place is certainly not exciting in wet weather. There are two Americans and two English here, added to this we have 50 fat Fraus yelling all round us, gracious how they talk.  Their figures are like this: </p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"400\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"305\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1896/august/Frau.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>One wouldn't know one from the other, decayed lot, they are just like a collection of hens. </p>\n<p><strong><em>August 22nd</em></strong><br/>\n        Today my cold was so bad that I had to stay in bed until 3.30, it is a bore.

We then went into town and bought 2 cow bells and a cuckoo clock, after which we went to fetch my cape at the post office.  We had the greatest difficulty in getting it and blessed the Brookfieldites for not having sent it sooner. </p>\n<p><strong><em>August 25th</em></strong><br/>\n        We started for home this morning at 8.30. We stopped at Koln and visited the cathedral.  We had a lovely crossing and arrived at Liverpool St at 8 the next morning. </p>\n<p><strong><em>August 26th</em></strong><br/>\n        We just passed through town and went onto Brookfield.

We returned to breakfast at about 9 o'clock and \n        directly afterwards Bill and I went off to Westminster Abbey, by underground. \n        We got very good seats there right amongst the choir so we were able to \n        hear all right. After the service on returning to the station we found \n        it closed until 1 o'clock so we had to walk up to Trafalgar Square where \n        we got the bus right home. Of course we went on the top. It was lovely, \n        so nice being able to go out by ourselves. We saw a girl riding a bicycle \n        in bags, it was just beastly, especially as they were rather tight. Weather \n        very foggy and horrid, rather cold also. When lunch was over we all reclined \n        on different chairs and sofas with books which we read until about 4 o'clock \n        when Miss Shaw came in to see us. She is so funny with her everlasting \n        \"Lady Bloomfield\". B.G.S. also came in afterwards, she was looking \n        well and smart, we went to the Oratory and walked as afar as Gloucester \n        Road with her, it was very foggy but not really bad, and we reached the \n        Oratory in good time so that we had all the whole service, parts of it \n        are very funny, for instance at one time they say 7 \"Our Fathers\" \n        then \"Hail Mary\" and then they \"Glory\" each 7 times \n        for different things. I couldn't bear it and felt as if I must go out, \n        it seems so awfully irreverent to gabble out things like that, especially \n        \"Our Father\" but although I didn't like that part the sermon \n        was quite beautiful and not in the least Romish and singing was very nice. \n        <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>Feb 3rd</b></i><br/>\n        Went this morning with Eva and Yso to South Kensington Museum.

We used to know him at <span>(?)</span> and \n        then he was exceedingly good looking or rather I should say \"pretty\" \n        but he hasn't improved in looks at all and Bill thinks he is ugly now, \n        but I don't at all and like his face very much still.

Directly after breakfast \n        we three went off to Covent Garden to get some fruit and flowers but to \n        our great disappointment when we arrived there the flower market was shut \n        and so we had to content ourselves getting some tangerines, it is a funny \n        place and still funnier people, nothing but costermen and not a single \n        lady anywhere, so we felt rather out of it, especially when one of the \n        men ventured to remark \"they be fine big girls!\" I laughed, \n        I must say, but was rather alarmed at what they might say next. We then \n        determined to go down to High Street and get some flowers there. We got \n        what we wanted and as they were just ringing the bill up drove the boys. \n        We had lunch as quick as we could and then started off directly, Eva and \n        Mr Brocklebaum in one cab of course! and we three in another. We had a \n        ripping horse so arrived a good bit before they did. All I can say about \n        the Pantomime itself is that I have never seen anything so lovely before, \n        the scenery and dresses were too beautiful for anything, absolutely glorious. \n        <br/>\n        Dan Leno is splendid as the wicked Mama. I laughed till I was perfectly \n        ill at him. The transformation scene is lovely, they are all turned into \n        flowers, and the Spirit of the Pantomime with her six attendants float \n        up and down in the air with a large sort of silk embroidered sheet, then \n        the wedding procession if beautiful. The bridesmaids are dressed in gold \n        satin with sequence <span>(Wynne means sequins)</span> \n        and Cinderella in white satin with silver sequence, it is awful pretty. \n        The other parts are slightly vulgar but still one cannot help that, the \n        Baroness was lovely in the funny way! and the two sisters were also very \n        good, in fact I enjoyed it all very much. Coming home we came in the same \n        order and again we had splendid luck with our horse who ran away most \n        of the time and once we ran into a van but nothing happened more than \n        that and we got along in no time leaving the others miles behind (I daresay \n        they didn't mind). The boys both stayed with us to dinner and went away \n        about 9.15. I am so glad they both were able to come as we had such fun. \n        <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>Feb 5th </b></i><br/>\n        As for this day it has been the dullest and most decayed I have ever spent. \n        Did nothing all the morning but went to lunch with Amy Mangles of all \n        people, it was dull. We stayed awhile and jawed during which I and Yso \n        nearly fell asleep. We traipsed in to aunt Mary's where we had tea and \n        Mabel showed her room and this is the end of this beastly and decayed \n        day. Ta ha ha. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>Feb 6th</b></i><br/>\n        This proved to be a very fine day so Bill and I determined to start off \n        to the British Museum \"on our own\" as they say. We bused it \n        all the way but it was so cold that we went inside. When we were in Piccadilly \n        one lady enquired if we were in Bond Street, a bit off her chump I should \n        think. Well, we had a regular day at the \"Mujeem\" and as soon \n        as we got there we wended our way towards the mummies. They are most interesting, \n        one old fossil had her toes, skull and hair sticking out, it wasn't the \n        least pretty. The Library was very interesting, and the bindings of some \n        of the older books were simply lovely, they have got an immense collection \n        there. At 1.30 we repaired to the Express Dairy Company and had our lunch \n        which consisted of coffee and cakes, it was very nice. We then took our \n        bus back and arrived home at about 3.30, when Admiral came in to tea, \n        dear old thing. It was very nice her coming. In the evening we had such \n        an enjoyable time, we went with Henry Fairholme to see \"The Prisoner \n        of Zenda\". I can say here that it is the most excitable and interesting \n        piece I have ever seen put on the stage, at one time it is so realistic \n        that everybody jumps up with excitement. Oh! gracious I should love to \n        see it again. As for George Alexander he is too beautiful for words. I \n        am quite made about him. He does act so well. Eveline <span>(sic)</span> \n        Millard is very good and pretty too, also Lily Hanbury, but at the end \n        it is so frightfully sad that Beaver and I sat and sniffed and coughed. \n        I am no good at theatres like that. I always disgrace myself. I don't \n        at present seem to be able to get the play out of my head at all and anybody \n        who hasn't seen it can't imagine what it's like one bit. I could go one \n        prosing about it for hours. I had a very dull drive home with henry and \n        that's the end of this day. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1896/february/StJames_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<b><span>St James's Theatre charged the following: \n        Private Boxes \u00a31.11.6d to \u00a34.4s.

Just a nice little turn!! We also forgot \n        that lunch was at 1.0 and just scraped in in time to change, have lunch \n        and fly off again to the Frasers with whom we went to Olympia. We saw \n        first of all bicycle races, then the Derby, the latter was exceedingly \n        good and they say its very like but what was far and away the best was \n        the <a href=\"http://www.northeastmedals.co.uk/britishguide/punjab_frontier_despatches/chitral_vc_victoria_cross.htm\">Storming of Chitral</a>. It began with a Gymkana in the middle of which \n        came tidings of war, of course there is a great deal of commotion and \n        clearing away of tents etc and then the troops all assemble and drill \n        after which they fight like fun and take the fort. The wounded are carried \n        out by the ambulance, attended by nurses. It is really very good. When \n        it was over we went and had tea in the Winter Gardens where a most fascinating \n        band plays. Mrs Fraser is very kind but rather booish and doesn't talk \n        much. I don't suppose I shall see Pussie again before she leaves for Cairo. \n        I am rather sick about it but it can't be helped. I have been reading \n        rather an exciting book called \"The Haunted House at Kew\" by \n        Gertrude Warden. Its perfectly ripping and I sat up till 2.30 reading \n        it one night. My present one is called \"The Potters Thumb\".<br/>\n<span>(Gertrude Warden was a prolific writer, producing \n        many novels from the 1880's until the War. She was a leading light in \n        the Women Writers' Suffrage League. The book Wynne mentions had been published \n        in 1893. The other book mentioned is by Flora Annie Steel, and is still \n        available).</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>Feb 8th</b></i><br/>\n        Whilst Gran and Bill shopped in the High Street I went up Harrington Road \n        to get my hair washed. The man who washed it was very amusing and bucked \n        the whole time. When that was done I went with Bill to watch the bicycles \n        in the Park, but unfortunately arrived too late to see many of them so \n        we hurried home just in time to get our lunch as quick as we could. Eve \n        came in just at the last moment (I forgot to say she had been down to \n        Cam to a dance), we got two very nice hansoms but on the way a very nasty \n        thing happened to Eve and me. When we were driving through the Strand \n        a man suddenly rushed across our hansom, the horse knocked him down and \n        we went right over the thick part of his legs. We felt two distinct bumps \n        and the wretched man was picked up more dead than alive. Of course the \n        cabby poor beggar got it hot and probably will have to go to court about \n        it. We gave our names and address to the bobby but I hope nothing will \n        come of it, it was so beastly and I felt jolly sick after it too. <br/>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shop_Girl\">The Shop Girl </a>was of course too beautiful for words and Seymour Hicks \n        and Ellaline Terriss were too sweet as usual.

It is useless to try and remember what has happened \n        but in this time Mr Brocklebank came to us, he is very nice indeed and \n        rather good looking but has a nose like this .....<br/>\n        which however one does not seem to notice after a bit. Walter and John \n        teazed us very much because he said he had such beautiful eyes but this \n        bit of news is quite true for they are quite worth looking at!! Well it \n        strikes me I am meandering rather so I'll go on! From about the 15th to \n        the 20th we did absolutely nothing, Ebbo went to Witham and Eve to Gillingham \n        to the Hayes, so we came to Town yesterday which was the 20th. Eve joins \n        us again on Thursday and Bill either Sat or Mon I think. Yesterday we \n        made our journey very comfortably and were not in the least tired when \n        we arrived at 4.30. After tea Gran and I went to see the Fairholmes but \n        found only Alice in, we talked a lot about all the relations. Went afterwards \n        with Miss S to the High Street and did some shopping, and then we retired \n        at a very early hour to bed. Today, 21st, it has been very foggy but in \n        spite of this we all went shopping at Barkers the whole morning. I ordered \n        monogram note paper for myself, it is sort of very pale and rough, azure \n        blue, with a dark blue <span>(monogram)</span> on \n        it. I think it ought to be rather sweet. After lunch we rested, had tea \n        early after which Miss S went to see her people and we to Aunt Mary. Gran \n        <span>(in her eighties)</span> would give me dreadful \n        frights by insisting on nearly running under huge Drays and busses and \n        flying across the roads 60 miles an hour. She is so rash. However I piloted \n        her home safe all right. It seems so lovely to be up here again, and not \n        having seen scarcely a cab for weeks we find it even exciting seeing a \n        hansom!! <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>January 22nd, Wednesday</b></i><br/>\n        I haven't got very much to put in today. This is a good way to begin, \n        because we have done nothing but shop all day long, in the morning we \n        went to the Grove with Gran and in the afternoon Miss S and I went to \n        the High Street and did a lot of shopping. I got some things for my work \n        box, I think I have about fitted it up now. Eva is going to a big ball \n        tonight. I hope she will enjoy herself. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>January 23rd</b></i><br/>\n        I am so lazy in remembering to write my diary, and I go leaving it for \n        days and then cant remember what to write when I do begin. I think on \n        this morning we went to the Grove to do some trifling in the way of shopping!! \n        Dear old Gran walks so very slowly we can hardly get along at all. I nearly \n        did such a stupid thing: I had two letters to post and having them in \n        my hand with my purse I crossed the road to drop them into the box and \n        by mistake I very nearly dropped my purse in instead. All but. I was in \n        a fright. In the afternoon Eva came, she enjoyed her dance well enough \n        but to our great astonishment at about 5.30 who should drop in but my \n        great joy himself*. He had been down home with the Marriotts for some \n        shooting and thought on his way he would just come and see us, he was \n        looking very fit and jolly. No more for this day.<br/>\n<span>(*Wynne is referring to Charles Maclean - see \n        <a href=\"../../diary_layout/wynneframeset.html?0,love1,\" target=\"diary\">Love</a>)</span></p>\n<p><br/>\n<i><b>Jan 24th</b></i><br/>\n        In the morning of this day Eva and I went up to Oxford Street with the \n        view of going solely to Mrs Hunt's office servant hunting, but on the \n        way we went into a jewellers shop and bought quite by surprise the Silver \n        Wedding Present - it is a pair of very pretty wine decanters, silver mounted \n        and a very queer shape. I hope they will like them. It is so difficult \n        to choose a thing like this. My brother, \"E\".v.\"A\". \n        came today. I am delighted and am looking forward to having a very good \n        time with her. <span>(Wynne like most people then \n        had a habit of using numerous <a href=\"http://www.wynnesdiary.com/section_pages/editor/viewer_8.html\">nicknames</a>...here she is referring to her \n        cousin, <a href=\"http://www.wynnesdiary.com/section_pages/family/family2.html\">Ysobel Butler</a>.

It is a \n        very nice sort of church, the sermon was a good length and the music very \n        fast, in fact it was impossible trying to keep up with them. Coming out \n        who should we meet but Miss Shaw, the last person in the world, it was \n        odd. She is coming to tea tomorrow. In the afternoon we all went to hear \n        a concert in the Albert Hall, it was lovely, especially the string and \n        brass band of the Royal Engineers. They did play well. Next Sunday the \n        Royal Artillery is to perform so probably we go again. A man played \"The \n        Storm\" on the organ, it was grand, he did the thunder so well and \n        the wind, it was very realistic. When we came home to tea the Fairholme \n        boys called and stayed some time, then walked with us to the Oratory where \n        we heard some beautiful singing, but it's a very funny service, they do \n        such a lot of bowing and scraping one feels rather strange at first, and \n        it did not look like a church in the least. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>Jan 27th</b></i><br/>\n        This morning soon after breakfast Yso and I went down to the High Street \n        and did some rather interesting shopping. She bought a gold bracelet and \n        a pair of Oxford shoes, and I bought a pair of evening shoes besides some \n        trifles. After dinner she and I again went to the Norfolk Hotel as we \n        had heard Pussie was in Town. I had heard it this morning from the Wanderer \n        and of course I was game to go and look for her at once, but we found \n        that they were not there, so we went to one or two shops and as we were \n        sitting in one who should pass the door but the great Puss herself. I \n        was so surprised and delighted, we went and talked with them a long time \n        after which she came home to tea with us, dear old girl. I was so glad \n        to see her again. After she had gone who should turn up but the two Wilkinson \n        girls, really it is funny how two such nice things come together. <br/>\n        This morning our mail came in, a most interesting one with letters from \n        the dear Barent Birds. They are well and soon will be with us again, Mother \n        in fact both of them, have been making preparations for next year's outing, \n        I do hope it wont go to smoke as I am so longing to go out. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>Jan 28th, Tuesday</b></i><br/>\n        In the morning Eve and I went out shopping, and Yso and I went in the \n        afternoon to the Imperial Institute. We went to the Indian Department, \n        there are a lot of awfully good things there, so like it all. There was \n        a little model of Bengal bazaar, just exactly like it all, the pictures \n        were also very good, some sets of native armour were very interesting \n        besides. In the evening Charlie Fairholme went with us to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Artist's_Model\">\"Artist's Model\"</a>. We had very good seats although we could only get them in \n        the Upper Circle. I enjoyed it very much. One thing which was rather a \n        pity, they had got a lot of new songs instead of the old ones which we \n        knew so well. I was rather disappointed but I enjoyed it all so much that \n        there was no time for disappointment.

I think its one of the most beautiful churches I have \n        ever seen, the marble is too lovely for anything.

Bill thought she wouldn't go out, but went with me after \n        dinner to a shop in the Brompton Road to fetch my padlock which by the \n        way is a great success. When we were walking there I met Mary Castleman \n        and a Mr Openshaw, to whom I was introduced at Lords (or rather who was \n        introduced to me!) but he didn't see me which wasn't much loss! When we \n        had been home about 15 minutes I heard a most peculiar sort of screaming \n        noise and on looking out saw two women walking along, one of which looked \n        like a nurse and the other was simply yelling at her as loud as she could. \n        It sounded something like a cat and a peacock combined. I think she must \n        have been mad. It was so horrid to hear her as she seemed perfectly furious. \n        Bill and I had a very comfortable tea together. Didi's collar came from \n        barkers with \"Trin Cole\" inscribed on it, it looks awfully smart \n        and we are going to address it to \"Master Richard Medleycotte, 4 \n        Jesus Lane, Cambridge\". I wonder what Buttons will say. <span>(Another \n        of Wynne's practical jokes? Her brother was there at the time and this \n        could well have been addressed to him.

It strikes me that we go there \n        every day, you see its our nearest shopping street. EVa and I went this \n        morning and then we went to Cecil Roys and got tickets for the \"Shop \n        Girl\" and the \"Prisoner of Zenda\", to which we go on Thurs. \n        and Sat., and Tues. to the pantomime. I am looking forward very much to \n        them all. <br/>\n        John came over to see us, he had lunch with us and stayed till after tea \n        and then departed about the middle of the afternoon. Having nothing better \n        to do we commenced to chuck cushions at each other and when our rotting \n        was at its height who should come in but that old cat Mrs Maugham. Of \n        course there was a sudden lull, and as the room was filled with our cigarettes \n        there was no disguising what we had been doing! however I hope we shocked \n        her well. <span>(Bear in mind Wynne was then 16, so \n        was clearly very fast for her age and period...lucky her to be living \n        with such a relaxed family! - but read on...)</span> We played whist after \n        dinner and went to bed, Yso and I each armed with a glass of claret.

At 9 they brought us some sausage and ham with weak grey coffee for breakfast, ugh!  It was beastly.  I was nearly sick, but our lunch was very nice and at 5 we reached Frankfort where we changed and came on almost directly reaching Homburg at about 5.45.

We belong to a library here which is a great thing.  Tomorrow I have another pine bath. Went to the Kurhaus again and listened to the band.  Saw the \"family\" there.

We heard from them all about the Canal block, it must have been beastly, they were there for 4 or 5 blessed days and it was a German vessel and not a man-of-war that was blocked there.  Went to church this morning and it rained the whole time. </p>\n<p><strong><em>March 2nd</em></strong><br/>\n        On Sat I had a vile chain sent me and this morning I got another, both of which I did.  I think I must be turning into an angel.

Somehow Ray and I got on ahead I don't know how it happened! but we jawed the whole time and coming back we were caught in a pelting shower of rain which continued until evening.  R told me rather a funny story about Mrs Barnet and Den.  One day the latter called in and she said to him \"Ah sir, I shall be glad when I'm gone\" and he answered thinking she said something about the weather \"Yes, so shall I\"!!!  What a fatal mistake. </p>\n<p><strong><em>March 4th, Wednesday</em></strong><br/>\n        No news by the post whatever for anybody.  We asked the Hightons over to tea tomorrow and I had a letter from R saying that they could come, that's about the 100th note I've had from over there and I get so chaffed about it.  Bill and I are painting a model together, its such fun and as it poured all day long we had a good long time at it.  Its a blue teapot and cup with a fan at the back leaning against a terracotta background. </p>\n<p><strong><em>March 5th</em></strong><br/>\n        We had lots of news from the \"Parients\" today.  Mother wrote such an interesting letter form Rome and also sent me a post card which I am putting in here because its so pretty.  Miss S having gone to Blandford we are having a good long time at our model.  I had one of my chairs returned to me this morning which I instantly threw into the fire.  The Hightons came to tea this afternoon.  When tea was done we played all sorts of games amongst which was fortune telling.  This was most amusing.  Bill and I make it our business to chaff R who is the most nervous person I know I think but he is so good and takes it so well. </p>\n<p><strong><em>March 6th</em></strong><br/>\n        ----------------------------------------!!!</p>\n<p><strong><em>March 7th</em></strong><br/>\n        Went to our class this morning after which retired to the dentist where I had a tooth stopped and am going again next Saturday, how I hate him.  We took our model to show Miss Coles and she was so nice about them and said ever so many nice things.  After the dentist we went to lunch at the Daniels' new house, they have it so nice now, everything is quite new.  We had the sad news of poor old Col. Todd's death.  He had very severe bronchitis and died on Friday night, poor old man.  He only last(ed) a few months after she did. In the afternoon we all went over to the Highton's to tea, we played all sorts of silly games and told fortunes again.  I of course got very chaffed, silly old apes they all are. <br/>\n        Last Thursday I had a letter from CWM.  He is very well and seems in splendid spirits. (<span>Diary then goes into private code: \"he said so many sweet things that I feel quite embarrassed\"</span>). It was just 6 weeks since he wrote to us, bad boy. <br/>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>March 8th, Sunday</em></strong><br/>\n        Weather simply beastly, very muggy and yet raw.

We passed their house in safety and as we were going up the road to Blandford it began to pour and at Down Barn Farm we saw the Daniels driving down the hill (they were going to teas at the Pennys) so to escape them we rushed into the farm on the pretence of getting shelter, but when we came out who should we meet but Amy Daniel who was riding!  It was fate!  We managed to escape with a long made up story and went on.  We got just dripping wet and our hair got all draggled like rats' tails.  When we got home we had to change everything so we dressed and at 7 the parents arrived, it was nice having them again. Of course we had loads to say and that very evening M unpacked a lot of things.  She brought me two turquoise brooches, one a butterfly which one clips on by his wings and the other a wee frog with a pearl stripe down his back.  She also gave me some flowers for a hat and some curiosities for my cabinet among which was a rosary from Father made of eucalyptus wood and a most beautiful old Roman vase from the baths at Carra Calla <span>(sic)</span>.  Mother has bought herself some lovely old Tuscan peasants jewellery and one or two other things.  They gave us all some lovely \"Guiandinas\" which will not take long to finish I'm thinking, also some eucalyptus liqueur from the Trappists at Rome . <span>(The guiandinas Wynne mentions were probably chocolates - gianduja was a chocolate containing hazelnut paste, and was a well known speciality). </span></p>\n<p><strong><em>March 10th</em></strong><br/>\n        Did nothing at all today but listen to the parents news of which they have a lot.  I had a letter from Nellie Macnaughton and also from A.R who has at last thought it necessary to write to me, she is at the hospital at present and I jolly well know that it will be some time before I give her the pleasure of an answer. </p>\n<p><strong><em>March 11th, Wednesday</em></strong><br/>\n        Today there was a very dull post and I didn't get any letters at all.  Mother and Bogel went into Blandford to the Presentation of<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Portman,_2nd_Viscount_Portman\"> Lord Portman's picture</a>.  They say it was very good. This evening they got hold of this diary and made such fun of it, they were very much amused at the portrait of Miss S! </p>\n<p><strong><em>March 12th</em></strong><br/>\n        Bogel has put me on an allowance now, 10/- a month for my boots and gloves.  I like it awfully, its such fun having a little money of one's own.  The weather at present is vile and Mater says she is going straight back to Italy and I certainly don't blame her.  I forgot to say that yesterday afternoon the Highton's came with us for a walk and also to tea, they all insisted upon having their fortunes told again and are all most amusing about it. </p>\n<p><strong><em>March 19th, Thursday</em></strong><br/>\n        A week has elapsed since I last wrote this in which nothing particular has happened.  Today is Mother's birthday and I gave her a table hussiff made of white and yellow satin, rather neat.  To me it was a red letter day.  In the morning Bogel, Mater and I went into Blandford and ordered my bicycle!!  I am nearly mad with joy.  Its a \"Sunbeam\" with Dunlop tyres, and I am to get it sometime before Easter and until then Conyers is going to let me have one to ride.  Its a dark cherry tipped with gold and I am going to have a brass plate put on it with my name and address thereon!  I am so longing for it to come and I could go on talking about it for ages.  We also had a most delightful afternoon - we all walked up to pick daffodils, and after having gathered a lot we walked back to the dog cart which we had left at Bit Cottage and had our tea, and then walked home.  All the way we chaffed R<span>(ay)</span> H<span>(ighton)</span> about his different girls.  He is an ape.  As if it mattered to us if we know their names or not, still he is in an awful fright about us knowing them, old donkey.

Mother gave Bogel a gold watch  and he to her a diamond necklace.  Quite a collection.  The weather was just beautiful in the morning but clouded over rather in the afternoon.  A few days ago RH declared he never had a chance of making a face at us in church because we never looked his way, so we told him he wouldn't have to complain of that today.  Accordingly we both stared at him the whole service through, and I'm afraid he rather lost his temper over it which of course was of no matter to us as it made it all the funnier.

We started today by the 11 train.  Coming up we had great fun, there were two people in the carriage and at intervals Mother and I made the most awful faces at them.  I thought the others would have had a fit from laughing.  After we arrived we got a cab which had a horse in it just like Puck to look at, only not so fat and strong.  We took quite an hour and a half to get from Vauxhall to the Norfolk as the horse was only warranted to go on two legs.  All the little boys laughed at us in the streets, however we took no notice whatever.

When we got home we had had about enough of it.  Soon after the Butlers came.  We had a cheerful party in spite of it being our last evening together.  We didn't do anything this evening as there was a lot to see to and we went to bed very early. </p>\n<p><strong><em>November 20th, Friday</em></strong><br/>\n        Got up at 7.

I rode Harlequin. </p>\n<p><strong><em>December, Tuesday 1st</em></strong><br/>\n        I have been lazy in not writing my diary but nothing of importance has happened.

I was rather disappointed but we had a nice ride so the day was not altogether lost.  I have heard again from the travellers.  Marseilles was the last place.  We have seen the ship advertised as having reached Port Said, they are getting on fast.  I wonder how Ell is getting on with the voyage and how often he has had occasion to call steward.

The real object of Wynne's affections was Charles Maclean, whom she named \"the Earl\", which you can read about in the special Love section, but there were clearly others under consideration). </span></p>\n<p><strong><em>June 2nd</em></strong><br/>\n        I must just quote a little incident that occurred to us on our return journey from Sandhurst last Saturday.  As we got into the train Sonny said \"Why look here is a busby case, who does it belong to, 'Macallister MaGregor' \" and on looking up he saw the only man sitting in the corner of our carriage! (having known him previously).  Well I looked at him of course and saw that he was exceedingly \"lovely\" to look at and as he stared out of the window all the time I had the opportunity to glare at him for at least six miles, he was beautiful, just too mic <span>(?)</span> looking for words and now Mother chaffs me all day long about him.  I'm sure if he knew he ought to be flattered!  Mother has gone to Chettle to go with them to Salisbury.  Oh! how I wish I were with her but that's naughty because Bogel<span> (her father)</span> would then be alone, but better luck next time.  This evening is lovely and I am afraid I am being foolish enough to be a little melancholy and the only thing that cheers me up is the thought of the Earl's return home.</p>\n<p><strong><em>June 3rd</em></strong><br/>\n        Weather just beautiful.  Read my task and wrote letters in the morning and did stamps and gardened all the afternoon, so you see I have had a regular \"rural\" day.  Hebditch has done nearly all the planting out now and the place looks so clean and tidy.  We had a wire from Mum to say that she wouldn't be home till tomorrow but I hope she will come then as I believe Mr Clarke is to appear and as I don't know him in the least it would be slightly awkward.  I wrote a letter to C.W.M. this afternoon and addressed it to Southampton hoping it will reach him in safety but I have my doubts. <span>(CWM is Charles Maclean, aka the Earl).</span><br/>\n        Mother returned today but Mr Clarke is not to be here until Monday.  We drove into Blandford, such a rare occurrence I have to put it down. </p>\n<p><strong><em>June 5th</em></strong><br/>\n        Drove again to B or rather cycled, did pounds of shopping.  I have got myself an old woman sun bonnet, its just sweet, I also got some pink print which I am going to have made up by Mrs Jennings who does them very neatly for the maids. The \"uninteresting, stodgy, doughy but good natured under done bun\" came over this afternoon.  We generally see him on Saturdays. </p>\n<p><strong><em>June 6th, Sunday</em></strong><br/>\n        Its a lovely day and a little cooler than yesterday.  I got no letters this morning and as I am writing this before breakfast there is not much to say, but I must depart now as its prayer time. <br/>\n        (Later)  I think there is nothing more to add here as nobody called and we only went to church as usual.</p>\n<p><strong><em>June 7th</em></strong><br/>\n        Today both the Mater and I went and got up early as she had all the butter to make and I the flowers to do.  The butter took over three hours to do, the flowers not so long.  Directly after lunch Mother set off to meet Mr Clark arriving back with him at about 3.30.  I shall here describe him - he is middle height, fair, and a little stout, that's to say not thin!! Very pleasant in manner but not very good looking and I'm afraid in connection with a little certain \"affair d'amour\" that I think him a fool for his pains as I count him 40 times too good for her, she being a foolish little minx while he is a regular good sort.  At 4 we started for Badbury Rings where we took our tea and where we were met by the under-done-bun who appeared with a huge cake as a contribution to our tea.  When we had unpacked everything, to our horror we found that \"husk\" of a maid had gone and forgotten the teapot and tea! did you ever hear of such rot.  That wretched *** had to traipse down down on my machine to fetch them, at least he offered to and wouldn't let me go, I could have beaten that goat of a girl, however we had great fun and at about 6.30 we went home again. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_3": {"order": 3, "title": "Viewer 3", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1897/june/OldPhoto_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>This faded (and fading) photo is of a school XI - Woodcote.

We had the most extraordinary dinner of which I can scarcely give a detailed account, but one awfully funny thing happened.  Mother told the maids to bring in a small quantity of ice for the whisky so in it came and we all invested largely in it.  What was our dismay to see our drinks turn rather a weird soapy colour and on investigating the matter we found the fools had brought in washing soda instead of ice!!

I thought I would leave these 4 days diary until now so here goes\u2026we went by the 10.56 and met Rachel at the station, also the Hughes Gibbs with whom we travelled up as they had reserved a carriage.  This we found rather nice as the train was very full.  When we arrived Rachel very sweetly took our luggage to the Norfolk as she lives quite close there and Mother and I went off on different business.  We then returned to dress for dinner as we were to dine at the Cafe Royal with Poppet and CWM.  We started at a quarter to six and arrived there at 7, the crush was so fearful we could scarcely get along.  Charlie was looking more beautiful than ever but not very well and so thin, however down at home we will fatten him up well! We enjoyed an excellent dinner and afterwards walked over to La Poupee which I cannot say I found so funny as before. <span>(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_poup%C3%A9e\">Operetta by Edmond Audran</a>, which ran very successfully in London in an English translation)</span><br/>\n        Harry insisted on our coming to his Club and having drinks which we did accordingly, Mother and HC in one hansom and I and CWM in another.  As far as he was concerned I think he enjoyed himself immensely but I cannot say that drive amused me as I was the whole time trying to make him see reason which is needless to say he wont.  We arrived home at 10 minute to 1 having had a regular spree. </p>\n<p><strong><em>June 22nd, Jubilee Day.</em></strong><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/TheQueenandspecialanniversaries/HistoryofJubilees/QueenVictoria.aspx\">(Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee)</a><br/>\n        Today at 5.30 we arose from our downeys in order to arrive in time at our seats after a hurried breakfast consisting of a cup of coffee. We tore off with Alice, Rachel and Harry in a bus to Piccadilly- having ridden as far as possible we got off and walked to our seats in crowded and broiling streets which all looked lovely being hung with flags and decorated up to the roofs, the Baroness Burdett-Cootes house being among the finest was all hung with purple and gold. St James Street was wreaths all over and our house in Pall Mall was beautifully decorated with white and mauve orchids and ferns, it was just too beautiful for words.<br/>\n        We arrived before 8 and had to wait until eleven. I cannot describe it properly and exactly because I've forgotten how they all came but I know our street was lined with the Manchesters and in the procession first came hundreds of soldiers Colonial and English, next all aide-de-camps, equerries etc and then the Royal carriages with all foreign representatives, the Royal family and lastly the Queen - in her carriage was the Empress Frederick and the dear Princess of Wales who as usual was looking sweet, the queen looked very well and the cheers were simply dense as she drove along, people went nearly mad with excitement and the street was a perfect sight with waving hats and handkerchiefs. The Prince of Wales, Duke of Cambridge and Duke of Connaught rode beside her and her carriage was drawn by five or six pairs of horses almost buried in gold trappings and led by men in most gorgeous livery. When it was once started it didn't take long and the whole show was past us soon after 12 o'clock. I am indeed glad I saw it, as of course none of the present generation will ever see such a sight again.<br/>\n        I must not forget to add that we (Rachel and I) had an excellent lunch and made the acquaintance of a most charming young man who was most attentive to us and came and sat with us after it was over and talked for quite a long time.  He was nice looking, fair, and tall and said he lived in Blackheath.  I wonder if he knows the Wilkinsons and if we shall ever see him again!<br/>\n        As soon as it was possible to move we all went to the park for a while, and at 4 we started to tea at the Oriental club when after awhile we were joined by the Butlers, Uncle Walter, (and others).  When we had eaten and stuffed as much as possible we strolled down Bond Street and each took our different ways. </p>\n<p><strong><em>June 23rd, Wednesday</em></strong><br/>\n        So having done my duty in describing yesterday I must begin on this early before breakfast.  Mother left for Plymouth and I by my little own self sat me down to wait for the Castlemans who were coming to fetch me for the Academy.  Accordingly they arrived three strong including Jack Moon who is such an amusing fellow.  The Academy was a sight to see and I don't know who laughed so much as I did over \"Loves Baubles\", a more grotesque production I have never yet seen.  We all had convulsions and behaved so badly, however rotten show as it is I am glad I went and mean to go again when I am up for Lords. <span>(Wynne is referring to a painting by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byam_Shaw\">John Byam Liston Shaw</a>, known as Byam Shaw. Apparently mirth greeted some of his other work, some of which appears to be lost). </span><br/>\n        When I returned I found the beautiful Charles awaiting me and we had lunch together after which he took me down to the New Gallery which is on the whole better than the Academy I think. Poor Owl isn't in the best of spirits I fear and every time I say anything I seem to put my foot in it.  I hope he is not going to be depressed because of a certain affair as that would be foolish in the last extreme. In the evening as I was sitting reading my weird and beastly task (this appears to be the sole educational element of her life at that time), when all of a sudden I heard a voice say \"come out into Onslow Gardens\" and looking up saw R and Mr Moon, so out I went and we sat out for over an hour smoking and shrieking.  The illuminations were lovely all round and I suppose in the city they must have been exquisite. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_9": {"order": 9, "title": "Viewer 9", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1897/june/Tattoo.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>This is the diary open at the entry about the tattoo, that you can read in the next window...clearly Wynne did not travel First Class!</strong></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"490\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"367\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1897/june/Tattoo_page.jpg\" width=\"490\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>This first diary was quite small.

Disastrous indigo news this morning, hang it, but the less said about it the better so I wont enlarge.  The C's arrived and to our great delight we went to B after all and a more amusing afternoon I have never yet experienced.  We went 6 strong.  Arriving there about 4 we hastened to tie up the horses and make the tea, unpacking all the things.  We made the men heat the kettle and all the way through tea that goat Seamus (one of the horses) would keep rubbing his collar, consequently Harry had to jump up 40 times to stop him.  As soon as we had finished those wretches Mother and Harry walked away and left us to put all the things away and look after the horses, so thought we this is not to be borne and as soon as we had put our tea things away Rachel and I started off to claw in the others leaving Mary and Haskins in charge of the horses.  We found the culprits seated on the top of the furthest ridge right away on the horizon! so we yelled and shrieked for them to come and play games, then when we had got them fairly home we and the other two shrunk off, depositing the victims in our place with the horses.

Harry, Alice, Giddy Montgomery, Mother and I.  Only when we had gone for about 3 miles GM declared it was too much for her and returned.  Well, we got to Warder at about 1.15, had our lunch, after which we three strolled around and Alice sat down to do some sketching.  About a quarter of an hour after, the rain began to come down and very soon it simply poured, unfortunately catching us separated.  I was hunting in a vault and Mother and Harry in the caves, so there I sat quite alone for a whole blessed beastly hour, smoking a cig and eating a \"muff\"!!  When it cleared we were able to make it homewards, Harry and I coasted nearly the whole of Win Green to Chettle, it was lovely.

I must explain that we were on our way to lunch with the under done bun and he was to have met us but as we were so late he gave it up in despair and left so we had to find the best of our way to his farm.  When we arrived we had an excellent lunch for which we were all simply longing.  He presented us all with squirrels' tails which we put into our hats. After lunch we inspected the farm and then at about 3.30 we set off riding to Southampton.  Its just 15 miles and the roads are just perfect.  We trained from S to Wimborne and then rode home doing in all close on 30 miles.  The C's stayed the night with us but we all felt too tired to romp at all! </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_3": {"order": 3, "title": "Viewer 3", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n\n<p>May 28th</p>\n<p>The Sandhurst Ball</p>\n<p>This is Wynne's formal coming out, and she is very excited about it. </p>\n\n", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 28th, Friday</em></strong><br/>\n        I was in a terrible state of excitement this day as it was one of the most eventful ones of my life!! Namely my coming out day and I am going to give a long and detailed account of it so that there will not be the slightest chance of my forgetting the smallest event of the day or evening.  To begin with Father drove us to meet the 12.42 train which we caught in good time having to change at Templecombe and Woking.  Already at the latter station the train was beginning to fill with smartly dressed girls bound for Sandhurst.  We very nearly did an awfully stupid thing, we had to get our box labelled to Woking as they wouldn't book it farther.  Well at this station we quietly got into the train, forgetting all about relabelling our box and only just thought about it in time to get it seen to.  Imagine our feelings if we had left it behind!!  Well we found Sonny awaiting us at Camberley and having procured a bus we drove off to the College to have tea with Sonny in his rooms.  Then we met a man who he had invited up from Brighton (to meet us) and I may as well say at once that he was the most charming person it has lately been my lot to meet.  Rather short but exceedingly good to look at, dark brown hair and eyes, straight nose and very much burnt by the sun, not his nose in particular I don't mean!!! but his face altogether.  His name was Osborne and I shall count it my fortune if I ever happen to meet him again which I sincerely hope I shall.  Tea in Sonny's rooms was great fun, the kettle refused to boil and by way of finding out if it was hot or not he used to put his finger  in the kettle! After tea we walked down to our rooms at Blackwater, dressed, and had dinner at our leisure after which we drove at 9 o'clock to the Gym were the dance was being held.  We arrived in good time as it began at 9.30.  Sonny and Mr Osborne soon arrived and we began making out our dances.  Sonny did his duty like a man and introduced 10 men altogether in consequence of which I danced every single dance, the first of which was taken up with introductions! I am going to put down the names of the men I know and see if in a few years time I shall remember any of them.  The band, supper and floor were perfect and the rooms were very prettily decorated. I cannot write enough about the enjoyment of the thing.  It all went so quickly that it was gone before one realised anything about it.  There are also lots of things I should like to put down about it but as I don't think it would be quite the thing I must trust my memory serving me as well as this would.  My dress did awfully well but I got my shoes quite black.  We finished at 3.30 which was rather early I think. <br/>\n        Dances:<br/>\n        1.   Mr Osborne<br/>\n        2.  Mr Pike<br/>\n        3.  Mr Lucas<br/>\n        4.  Mr Hughes<br/>\n        5.  Mr Fraser<br/>\n        6.  Mr Ridgeway<br/>\n        7.  Mr O'Donnel<br/>\n        8.  Mr Graham<br/>\n        9.

I cant say I think he seemed to mind much but of course I cant tell.  We have asked him down to Brookfield but its 9 chances to 10 he wont come.  Of our return journey I have nothing interesting to say.  I slept nearly all the way being rather dead and feeling beastly dull.

Of course its awfully silly but perhaps when I get a bit older I shan't be quite such an ass.  Bogel met us at the station and it seems just as if we had been away for years.

I visited two today only, \n        Mrs Richards and Mrs Marsh, both Sergts. wives and most superior ladies! \n        I found Mrs Marsh occupied in making a ball dress of white silk and lace \n        which she was to wear that night at the annual Sergeants Ball. She is \n        a bride and a very pretty one too, but white silk! odds bodkins! when \n        does she ever intend to wear it again?<br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>December 3rd</b></i><br/>\n        The morning was spent in scratching mail letters as hard as I could, this \n        is the Xmas Mail for India and consequently I have a good many to send. \n        <br/>\n<span><br/>\n          Wynne busied herself with preparations for departure. Now nearing the \n          end of her pregnancy, she was going down to her Mother in Dorset to spend \n          Christmas and to have the baby. She attended some of the local concerts, \n          did her shopping, showed her friends the collection of baby clothes she \n          had amassed and finally set off on the 16th, laden with presents and lots \n          of library books.

The Rose Show which was held in the grounds of Holland House was \n        of course delightful, though roses were certainly in the minority the \n        season being late and also an indifferent one, but such a display of carnations, \n        begonias, orchids and such things as annuals I have never seen. I think \n        though, that the House itself and gardens fascinated me as much. We met \n        Mabel early in the day and after we had seen flowers enough and eaten \n        lunch we went all over the gardens. People were not admitted into the \n        house, but the perfect picturesque appearance of it gave one an idea how \n        beautiful the interior must be. It is built of very old red brick and \n        white stone and was erected in the year one I should think!<br/>\n        The property belongs to the Earl of Ilchester and has done so for centuries, \n        there is a certain ball room in the house that was prepared for a ball \n        that was to have been given to Charles 1 but on account of non arrival \n        it was put off. The room however is the same now as it was then, curtains, \n        hangings, wall papers etc...all the same. <br/>\n        The month is nearly over and where it has gone goodness only knows, the \n        first week or so the weather was warm but ever since rough dark days and \n        a fitful climate has been our lot. Today, the 29th, it is blowing a hurricane \n        and I can only have the windows open an inch or two as the draughts are \n        frightful. It is a real pity that we have had such a vile summer.

The service was stranger and more distracting than ever, Mr MacMichael very absentminded as usual and being the 1st sunday of the month he spent his time in rushing in and out of the vestry dressed in different vestments.  Each time it reminded me of charades and I find concentration of thought in such an atmosphere an impossibility. I know it is done in all reverence but not having been brought up in that light the whole thing is mummery to me, the genuflexions, bowing, kneeling in the middle of the creed etc I eye with curiosity and somehow one feels that perhaps that sort of ritual is in its place in some grand splendid building where the whole service and music is in accordance but down here with a squeaky organ and no choir, painful intoning etc it all savours of the ridiculous rather than the sublime. I would rather say my prayers in some field close to God's earth - and how different I felt when sitting on the beach this evening in the quiet when the wind had gone down and I watched the glowing sun go down behind the sea casting a huge brilliant reflection and making one feel indeed that \"God's in His Heaven\". </p>\n<p><strong><em>Aug 7th, Monday, Bank Holiday</em></strong><br/>\n        To escape the crowd of Ilfracombe trippers which we knew would visit these shores today we took our elevens, lunch and tea and were out from 10.30 to 8!

Meanwhile the horrible trippers melted away from the beach below and we betook ourselves to the jewel beach where we sat till about 8.  Such a perfect day and how we have enjoyed it.  Maggie has caught a vile cold which is now passing to Win and Baby, such a bore.

I swam about, came out, and lay basking on the beach, then went for another swim and then instead of dressing in hurried shivers I just lay down behind my dressing rock draped in a towel and a hat because I feared the sun, and smoked a cigarette till I was dry! and how I sympathised with the ancient Britons who swathed themselves in woad!  We took our tea up to the Valley this afternoon, that lovely place of magic calm, the sun filled the fields with a golden light whilst the trees on the immense hills threw deep blue shadows and everything felt at peace.

On the hill I met Joe driving from the station.  She has been so seedy that I advised her to come down here and feed with us whilst I found a room (the last remaining one) for her in the village.  We followed the rest of the party into the Valley where we had tea and gathered mushrooms and heaps of blackberries. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Aug 10th</em></strong><br/>\n        Another glorious day and we spent the whole of it out of doors taking lunch and tea and having them in the bathing beach and cliff respectively.

We got Armstrong to drive us in by the 9.12 and there spent a busy day.  Being Market day the little old town was crammed and we made a characteristic sight going through the market ladened with honey, plums, beans and buns stuffed into our baskets and eating ginger snaps as we went. I then went to the Pottery Works where I bought two pounds worth of stuff for the bazaar and on to the basket makers where 20 baskets were added to my collection.  But the heat!  it was tremendous, the trains were crammed with trippers and market people and we were rejoiced to get back to the sea where we joined the party at tea on the shore.  Every evening in this dear little place one is simply overcome with sleep. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Aug 12th</em></strong><br/>\n        The tide being suitable we all made an expedition round to the cave on the right hand side, it was the greatest fun and I took many photographs which i hope to be able to be successful with on my return home.  There is something magic about that shore, the long stretches of yellow sand with the jagged rocks sticking up all over it and you feel as you walk along that there must be a water sprite sitting behind them but he is always gone when you look round the corner.  We went through both caves and gathered shells and the spirit of the place was upon us, the utter quietude and loneliness, the immense cliffs, the feeling of being far removed from all human creates besides ourselves.  Bathing took place in the afternoon from the Gilson beach and we all had a lovely tea at Mrs Giddy's - bread and honey, cake, raspberries and cream.  The children and Maggie went off up the hill to gather blackberries and we took books on to the cliff until 7.30. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Aug 13th, Sunday</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"350\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"281\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1911/august/TheCave.jpg\" width=\"350\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><br/>\n        The small still voice did not urge me to go to church today.

I am staying on the JB itself with Joe and Baby who is having her midday sleep, the others have gone round to the cave again and I wanted Maggie to see it.  Here we 3 are sitting upon this heavenly spot, there is not a sound in all the world except a lazy sigh now and then from the receding tide, the sun is fierce and strong but we sit in the shadow of the cool deep rocks, the sea is like oil and we are absolutely alone.

We are much amused with Nootle in the water - we have a pair of \"water wings\" and the child sticks them on and half swims and floats all over the place far out of her depth perfectly fearlessly and like a little frog. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Aug 16th</em></strong><br/>\n        Another of our long days on Bath Beach.  The tide was very high when we wanted to go round this morning but nothing daunted we scrambled round and when we were really stopped by the water we undressed and carried our clothes round.  At least I and the children did whilst the others followed more leisurely. We bathed a long time, the water was beautifully warm and an absolute absence of wind, quite lovely.   And all the time we are enjoying this perfect period of rest and quietude the world is in a distracted state, the English world at least.  Socialism is having its way and gigantic strikes are the result.  The London dockers are out and Town is we hear in a perfect state of chaos, the situation is becoming frightful.      </p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"90\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"523\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1911/august/Aug19_strip.jpg\" width=\"90\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong><em>Aug 17th</em></strong><br/>\n        Each day the paper brings more and more alarming reports of the extraordinary state of affairs.  Strikes seem to have become the fashion or as one striker expressed it, \"we're sure to get it pretty bad till we get some rain\". The dockers are still out and now a general railway strike is threatened which if it come into force will of course paralyse the entire country.  Liverpool is in a dreadful condition, the troops had to fire on the mob, wounding 4 and killing 2.  The strikers are all out, terrorising all trade and everything is at a standstill, all public houses and restaurants closed, also theatres.  There is no light or very little and the scavengers having gone on strike they expect pestilence as a natural consequence. Thousands of soldiers are on the move and the companies (rail) declare that even if all their men come out they will provide a service of some sort with the aid of the Government. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Aug 18th</em></strong><br/>\n        The weather continues to give us its apparently inexhaustible store of sunshine and each day is cloudless.  We cannot help revelling in it but the want of rain is becoming very very serious.  Water in some parts of the country is being bought at 2d a bucket and farmers are killing their stock because there is nothing for the poor brutes to eat, everyone's garden seems to have long gone brown and bare and I hear the stream at home is dry and all the trout are dead.  It is indeed a phenomenal year this one of 1911, what with Politics, Drought, and Strikes. I have not heard from H today and am wondering what is going forward.  He was going to come down here Monday but writes to say that all leave is cancelled and all officers and men away have been recalled.  It is a bitter disappointment to me.  I had so much looked forward to his coming. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Aug 19th</em></strong><br/>\n        We expected no posts today as the Railway Strikes were declared yesterday but to our intense joy the post man came twice as usual and we hear the South Western is still running.  Tons of troops have gone to Town and are bivouacked in the parks.  They are all armed and equipped  as for War.  It is most fearfully serious.  H writes that every available man has been warned in Aldershot but his Division and the 1st have not apparently gone, at least not all, only some from Bordon.  We don't get papers here till 4.0 and then we rush to the Giddys and get their Daily Mail.  People on holiday are sorely put to it, many trying to get home in vain and those intending to leave wiring to cancel their rooms.  The air is full of disturbances and one cannot get the whole thing out of one's head.  Our days however go on in the same peaceful way and we at any rate enjoy life to the full. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_7": {"order": 7, "title": "Viewer 7", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1911/august/TheLane_19eleven_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>This picture seems to say everything about that summer - somehow, it feels innocent, idyllic, and utterly without any sense of the cloud hanging over the whole country.

The water on both occasions was very high and most delightful, one got out of ones depth immediately and it felt most buoyant and warm.  It is too funny seeing Nootle paddling about with the water wings far out of her depth.  I went to church in the evening but I cannot do so again.  I try to put myself outside all the forms and ceremonies there indulged in, but fail miserably. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Aug 21st</em></strong><br/>\n        We spent a delightful day today.

Whilst down there we buried our milk bottle in the shingle to keep it cool as is our custom and forgot it!  Consequently Tootles had to extract milk from her home and our poor bottle was dashed to pieces on the rocks. Joe left us this morning very sad to go and we miss her much. I had a ripping surprise today, a wire from H to say he is actually coming here on Friday. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Aug 24th, Thursday</em></strong><br/>\n        I got two letters from Poggy today, he says that he is coming tomorrow.

We came back to lunch and went to bathe afterwards. at least Nootle, Olive and I, the other two children going out to tea with some boys they have picked up and Eve and H joining us at tea on the beach.  The tide was a very big one and we watched it racing in over the rocks for a long time, it was very grand.

We packed hard all the evening. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Aug 31st</em></strong><br/>\n        Alas at 9.30 the cart came for our luggage and a sorrowful party left the dear little place of delightful association.  I, Maggie and the children came down here to Brookfield, Herbert went to his home, Olive to Farnham and Eve and Win to Salisbury so it was indeed a dividing of the ways.  We parted at Exeter as we had to get into a train which stopped at Templecombe and as soon as we did we fixed up the tea basket and had a sumptuous lunch.  We arrived at about 3.30 and Mother who had been in Town came home at 6.30 bringing with her Herman who I was so glad to see again, he is a dear and such good company.  Mother had been up to see about a flat as she intends spending the winter in Town, this place being so bad for her rheumatism.

All of us then paddled and at 3.30 started for home, arriving at 5.30.  A very delightful day and the children were so rejoiced at getting to the sea.  Baby slept nearly all the way home and so did I, the effects of sun, sea and a big lunch.  This is what we look forward to a month hence at Lee.

We had not been there together since about 14 years and it was delightful to see it all again in each others company.  At 6.0 we took our leave having been much entertained chiefly by the wondrous clothes of the women which surpass all this year.  We dined at 7.0 and then went off to Her Majesty's where we saw a perfect cast do The Merry Wives,  Ellen Terry taking Mistress Page, she was simply delightful and we made her come back again and again.  I never saw such an ovation as she got. </p>\n<p><strong><em>July 5th</em></strong><br/>\n        In tropical heat H and I sallied forth to the Stores where we shopped hard all morning and were met there at lunch time by Eve.  The crush was frightful and the temperature 569 I should think.  We all three then went off to Olympia where the RHS are holding their big show this year.  The papers say there has never been such a show held in England before and I am sure I have never seen such perfect flowers.  It was all a dream and one could do nothing but walk round and gape and gasp.  We parted company then and came home only to rush out again to dine with the Grays.  One felt quite exhausted by the heat, it is quite phenomenal.  We all sat out after dinner in the cool evening air. <br/>\n<span>(The flower show referred to is what is now known as the Chelsea Flower Show -  was unusual in that the original RHS venue, Holland House, and the grounds of Chelsea Hospital, were unavailable, so for this year only it was held at Olympia). </span></p>\n<p><strong><em>July 6th</em></strong><br/>\n        The heat continues.  Great heat wave in America and so I suppose this is what is coming to us.  I revel in it and never feel so well but most people are feeling it dreadfully.

This afternoon I toiled up to a sale held in <span>(a)</span> garden, but left at 4.30 because I had to take Baby to tea at the Allasons, an amusement I cant say I enjoyed.  Children are so shy of one another, looking grim and repellant and these refused to play together at all!  I do not care for Mrs A, it always seems rather a fetish of hers to find fault with most things in a very superior tone which bores me. </p>\n<p><strong>July 7th</strong><br/>\n        Miss Cookson was coming over to have lunch but this wretched bother with the horses has deprived us of being able to send and fetch anyone so I have put her off.  There was an At Home at the Mess today to which we went, Major Dally sending up his car for us and we took with us Mrs Watson whose host was Mr Ardagh.  It was pleasant sitting there under the trees watching them play tennis and listening to the band.  After dinner we sat out on the terrace in the moonlight with the strong scent of the tobacco flowers , likewise the scent of the cigarettes to inhale! </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_3": {"order": 3, "title": "Viewer 3", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1911/july/MerryWives_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"490\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"628\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1911/july/MerryWives.jpg\" width=\"490\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_4": {"order": 4, "title": "Viewer 4", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n\n<p>July 8th - 14th</p>\n<p>The heat wave continues, and alongside local duties and entertainments, Wynne takes her group of mothers to the Festival of Empire at the Crystal Palace. </p>\n\n", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>July 8th, Saturday</em></strong><br/>\n        To lunch came the boys from Sandhurst.

We walked over to Farnham Castle across the Park after lunch to the Flower Show, arriving boiled but getting a lift home in the Grays' car.

I felt thankful that I had given up my original intention of going up to take my chance in the street. We all trooped off to the Coronation Service which I thought rather gloomy and the rain poured down, the village band played the children down to Church and away, starting back all in different keys, and after lunch the festivities commenced on the green, the poor children trying to do their dances whilst the band let forth watering miserable tunes. </p>\n<p><em><strong>June 23rd</strong></em><br/>\n        It was still raining this morning when we arose from our beds much depressed by the gloomy outlook at 4.30!  However we determined to go, and accordingly caught the 6.30 train, and on arrival took the Tube to Embankment from whence we walked to our stand at the Mall through the gaily decorated streets.  There was no crush whatever and everything was quiet and orderly.  We put our coats down on our seats and then walked up and down inspecting decorations, troops and crowds, besides meeting many friends on the same errand.  At last it was time to take our seats and soon the Procession came in sight.  I have since heard it described as \"dull\", of people being \"bored to death\".  Not wishing to be intolerant I cannot understand the mind that can remain unmoved by what we saw pass, the colour alone gets into ones throat to quote Kipling, and when one realised what it all meant one could not help feeling most justly proud of all it represented.  With the exception of a group of officers who were taken from the regiments of which the King is Hon Colonel, there was not a foreigner among them, the whole Procession was composed of Home troops and those of the Colonies and in the midst drove the King and Queen in their wonderful gilded coach drawn by 8 cream coloured horses covered with harness of scarlet and gold led by grooms in golden livery.  Troop after Troop of Household Cavalry, Hussars, Lancers, Dragoons, Guards Artillery, besides all the Colonial contingents including a big group of native officers in their perfect uniforms sitting their horses as only a native officer can.  I thought it all perfect and the people cheered and cheered again as it all went by.  When at length it had all passed we made out way to the Club where we had lunch and so home by the 4.12. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_7": {"order": 7, "title": "Viewer 7", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1911/june/HMSArgyll_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<p><strong>The Naval Review at Spithead</strong><strong>.

We found also that on the Thursday though dull at times they hardly had any rain so that our pity for them was wasted. <br/>\n        Again this morning we were greeted by torrents when we arose at 5 to start for our journey at 7 for Portsmouth where we had been invited by Walter Fallowfield to see the Naval Review from his ship, HMS Argyll.  Walter Poellnitz had left us in Town yesterday to go straight down and spent the night on board and accordingly on our arrival we met him and the other Walter at the ship's side.  It was very rough during our passage from the shore but fine as the sun came in sight at about 9 and stayed with us all day.  I never saw a more impressive sight than this, hundreds of enormous ships drawn up in 4 lines all dressed in flags and representing (the English ones alone) 81 millions of money.  We had lunch on arrival and soon after the Royal yacht commenced her progress.  I shall never forget the salute, it was grand, the air vibrated and the ship shook as one after the other the 21 guns were fired from ships.  We left again at about 6.30, getting home at 10.30 and feeling as if our brains would hold no more. </p>\n<p><strong>June 25th, Sunday</strong><br/>\n        It has poured without ceasing the whole livelong day.  My Christian man braved the weather and went to church but I became heathen today and had a real day of rest.      </p>\n<p><strong><em>June 26th</em></strong><br/>\n        Dinner party night and so much to do with various odd jobs and Walter returned.  To dinner came the Howards, Major de Rougement, CApt MacClellan and Mr Frazer.  The last two hailed from Puckridge Camp and were quite nice and dull.  Maj de R is always charming, one of those men whose manner is beyond reproach.  Mrs Howard looked charming, she is extremely handsome.  We played Whisky Poker as usual and Mr Howard won. </p>\n<p><strong>June 27th</strong><br/>\n        Quite a lovely day again, but it isn't gong to last so our \"home made\" weather prophet, Baker, says.<span> (How wrong he was!)</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>June 28th</em></strong><br/>\n        Today I had a lot of people here playing tennis.  I dont think I ever saw better play, they continued to do so until 7.30 and then rushed off in fright at the time.  The court is playing awfully well and I do so wish I could play the wretched game, I would give anything to do so. </p>\n<p><strong><em>June 29th </em></strong><br/>\n        A most inconvenient thing has happened, Sinnott <span>(the groom)</span> has gone down with flu.  I do hope he wont get complications.  Magazine meeting at 3.0 and at 4.0 the Grays turned up to take us down to the Milroys 'At Home'.  There a string quartet performed very nicely whilst we had tea, strolled and ate strawberries.  Also I smoked a cigarette with Capt Gray behind the bushes!  We afterwards flew off with them to their place and saw their lovely roses and sweet garden. </p>\n<p><strong>June 30th</strong><br/>\n        The last day of my beloved month has arrived, most of the things that have mattered in my life have happened in this month.  The garden is very gay with delphiniums, campanulas and monkshood at present and we are and have been busy sowing many spring things, seeds I got from Barr, Ryder having turned out such a failure this year.  We are much disturbed today on finding out that there is a fear of H's mare and the pony having mange.  It is too vexing if it is the case and they have been sent down to the sick lines to find out.  I only hope the horse wont get it too as we shall have an empty stable for weeks. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_9": {"order": 9, "title": "Viewer 9", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1911/june/Spithead_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>Centuries of British naval history!</strong></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"490\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"771\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1911/june/Spithead_card.jpg\" width=\"490\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n</td>"}}, "errors": [], "description": "\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The Diary - in JUNE... \n</p>\n<p>Wynne has \n              been keeping her diaries since 1895. </p>\n<p><span>The Coronation of King George V.</span> Celebrations in London and a visit to the Royal Review at Spithead.</p>\n\n"}, "march": {"viewers": {}, "errors": ["Seems to be a placeholder with no content."], "placeholder": true}, "may": {"viewers": {"viewer_1": {"order": 1, "title": "Viewer 1", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1911/may/Kids_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"400\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"497\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1911/may/Kids2_lge.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wynne's three children playing with wastepaper baskets - Herbert (Pink), Eleanore (Baby) and Ysobel (Nootie or Nootle).

I took my Nootle down to the town in the morning and we were quite hot.  Mother went off to Town by the 9.19 and by the 2.15 there came Miss Hamilton who put up with me this night and who I chaperoned to the Sapper Mess Dance.  Mr Glenday was out host, a typical sapper, but not a bad little pogbag.  He looked after her very well and I felt a real chaperone when at about the 14th dance they both came up to me and told me to be sure and say when I wanted to go home!! Ye Gods! It is the last thing I ever wish to do!  Major de Rougemont and Captain Dathie were both there, a gunner saving grace amongst such a wilderness of sappers!!</p>\n<p><em><strong>May 2nd</strong></em><br/>\n        Oh! a breathless morning.  We all cleared out for Brookfield and the whole house was like a disturbed beehive.  Mother and Gran and Clark went off by motor at 11, on the top of their car we piled cardboard hat boxes by the dozen and later in the day we learnt that as it came on to pour they had to bring all inside!  We started at 11.30 in the fly and brougham, each conveyance groaning with luggage.  We travelled 7 strong with 14 hand packages and 7 in the van!  We all arrived without mishap and found the others awaiting up, Gran not at all tired, the new servants installed but will not prove of any use, before Mother had been in the house half an hour they both came with endless complaints.

The house though clean is of course upside down, and we spent our time in getting the drawing room into order.  The floor has been stained and is having Indian rugs on it for the summer which is nice and cool and looks very pretty, and Mother as usual has brought many treasures from the East! We had one lovely experience, one box, which contained rice and taparee jam, on being opened we found that these two things had shed themselves over everything!  The mess was indescribable. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 4th</em></strong><br/>\n        I spent my time in filling the house with flowers and cleaning and unpacking silver so it all looks a bit more homely now. The weather today is stormy and cold. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 5th</em></strong><br/>\n        There is not much time to breathe at present, all are busy the whole day over various jobs and the time flies by.

He is just able to get away between the 2 Brigades practices. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 6th</em></strong><br/>\n        It has been a most perfect day, warm, still and sunny and we were enjoying a lovely lazy afternoon in the summer house when the Jacksons called.

Directly after lunch we all walked up to dear old Ashley, that place is a perfect dream.

One felt, what did one feel? sort of \"filled to the throat\" with the beauty of it all.

It will be good for her to see lots of soldiers, they are always a tonic.  As the house is upside down with cleaning Eve had to bed down with me, but we don't mind and it seems like very old days sharing a bedroom. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 27th, Saturday</em></strong><br/>\n        Review Day.  Lovely weather so we donned out best clothes and set off at 9.0 to meet the Jones, Gertie and Aim who all arrived by different trains. We drove straight on to the Plain and there saw this most inspiring sight.  It is always a joy and makes me want to cry!  We all got back here at 2.0 for lunch and they departed by various trains in the evening. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 28th</em></strong><br/>\n        The perfect weather still continuing we had the energy to walk over to the Garrison Church for the Cavalry Service.  The heat was tremendous but it is always a treat to go to such a church with its delightful organ and band taking the service and hundreds of men singing as only the tommy knows how.  We spent a most delightfully peaceful afternoon and evening, took rugs, chairs, books and pillows under the trees and there lazed away many hours in perfect quietude and peace.  It does do one good to get away and be alone sometimes. </p>\n<p><em><strong>May 29th<br/>\n</strong></em>Eve went back today.  We both drove down to the station today, she leaving by the 12.35 and I went up to Town 12.3. I drove to my Club and put up there for the night, there I found consternation reigning, the premises have been sold to the Junior Arts Club and the dear old Empress no longer exists and so in self defence I suppose I shall have to join it as one cant be without a Club.  I rushed about all day shopping and bought myself three very sweet little frocks, everything nowadays is so cheap and pretty and all frocks are made in one.  I took my things to the Goldsmith Co to be cleaned, went also to Douglas where I had my hair done and then home to dress and be ready at 7 for Major White -T who came for me to do Julius Caesar.  We dined at the dear old Troc and at 8 went on to His Majesty's to see this splendid tragedy.  It is very well put on and Basil Gill and Arthur Bouchier excellent, only I cannot away with Tree as Mark Antony, he is too Treeish for words, so full of mannerisms, mouthings and gestures, but anyhow the man is a genius.  The heat was awful and between the acts we went and stood out on the balcony where the air was lovely.  We supped at Scotts, quite a nice little restaurant in Piccadilly Circus, where the food is excellent and company ordinary. </p>\n<p><em><strong>May 30th</strong></em><br/>\n        I returned home today.  Such heat and so airless, storms hover round but pass us by and the garden is drying up.  I long for a real good rain. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 31st, Wednesday</em></strong><br/>\n        A very busy day.  Baker and I did all the bedding out, snapdragons in the four corner beds - stocks, asters etc in the side ones - geraniums in the big bed under the windows also in vases and boxes.  When I was immersed in this work of art Herman and Arthur Cope came in having come over from Sandhurst.  They were boiling and went off directly to have a bath.  Then we had tea.  When thoroughly replete I made them help me with gardening and at 6.30 the children and party arrived.  The boys stayed to dinner and left about 9.30, such a nice couple, so unaffected and free from frills.  I am going over to their dance on the 30th, and am to chaperone Rita there. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_9": {"order": 9, "title": "Viewer 9", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1911/may/Parade_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>May was an important month at Aldershot, and the King's Parade was something not to be missed.

She has a lot of awfully pretty painted things and Indian embroidery and I am holding a pottery stall of Dunmere, Barnstaple and Torquay stuff.  It is a great work as there are so many things to think about.  I do hope it'll be a fine day and a success. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Sept 2nd</em></strong><br/>\n        Eve returned today from Salisbury.

The Bazaar and nothing but the bazaar fills our minds and hands at present and we are at it all day long. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Sept 3rd, Sunday</em></strong><br/>\n        The season still keeps up its odd and extraordinary record.  A pitiless and blazing sun all day long and not a cloud to be seen.  We are horrified to find that the main well is drying up, the kitchen well has long since gone dry and what will happen if this one follows suit I cant think because the whole house depends upon it. There is only 6 inches of water there and we are necessarily very much restricted as to baths etc\u2026the place looks burnt and dried and tired, the lawns are brown, there is not a flower in the garden and the river like a road, all the fish being dead long since of course. As far as I can see there is no sign of a change.  I went to church twice, it was Harvest Festival and Eve and I of course were let in for decoration yesterday.  I do hope those at Hale will be finished with before I return. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Sept 4th, Monday &amp; Sept 5th, Tuesday</em></strong><br/>\n        Both these days were spent alike in breathless work and preparation.  I have had no time to do any writing or anything besides endless last jobs arranging and pricing etc and rushing about from morning till night.  My little Nootle has developed an abscess on her head, the result of a blow on the door down at Lee.  It is thought by H Daniell who inspected it today that she must have grazed it and got some foreign body into it so causing irritation and poison.  He says he must operate upon it with chloroform and is to do it on Thursday morning.  I do so hate the prospect but he says it will be nothing bad and it is naturally the only thing to do. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Sept 6th</em></strong><br/>\n        I fear we have suffered something of a disappointment.  The great day is over, the weather has been perfect, but the attendance was poor and we only made \u00a330.  There is \u00a320 more in the bank so the Church clock for which we are working has \u00a350 towards it but we expected to make quite that at the show alone.  I cant tell quite how it resulted but it seemed a lot of work for that small sum.  We were up at 6.0 working away like mad.  We had much kind help from various people and the Blandford tradesmen were most generous and most of our county acquaintances turned up but not many villagers but as the clock is only to cost \u00a360 it will not be difficult to find the extra.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sept 7th, Thursday</em></strong><br/>\n        At 9.30 both the Daniells turned up and after all the preparations were completed, administered chloroform to my Nootle and performed the operation.  It was over pretty soon and the child slept till 11.15, waking fearfully hungry but wasn't allowed food till 4.0.  I am so thankful it is over and the Drs are quite satisfied.  Poor baby she was so good and they said they never saw any child make less fuss or be more good. <br/>\n<br/>\n<em><span>Now click on the arrow and hear how Ysobel recalls that operation...</span></em><br/><audio controls=\"\"><source src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/mp3//YSO18_Doctor.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\"/></audio>\n</p>\n<p> <strong><em><br/>\n        Sept 8th </em></strong><br/>\n        Mother had been asked to have a drawing room meeting today for Waif boys but Mr Baverstock who is the mover got ill and it had to be put off in a hurry, however Miss Wingate, Mrs Bugg and Mrs Castleman Smith and her Mother turned up!

She left Win at Sherborne yesterday and feels parting with her very much poor dear.<span> (Eve was going back to India, so would not see her daughter again for another huge gap - in fact I think because the War intervened this may well have been the last time she saw her daughter until 1919). </span></p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_7": {"order": 7, "title": "Viewer 7", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1911/september/ChocsSoldier_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"490\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"450\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1911/september/ChocSoldier_lge.jpg\" width=\"490\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_8": {"order": 8, "title": "Viewer 8", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n\n<p>September 24th - 30th</p>\n<p>Eve stays with them and they all go to London for a final night out before she departs for India.

At about 12.30 Ni Elliot turned up and the delightful old dear proposed taking us all to dine, theatre and supper tonight, so H and I went to K.P. and got five seats for \"Peggy\", then Mother and N went off to lunch and we to the stores, lunching at the Grand Grill Room on our way.  Footsore and weary we taxied back to the Club where we had tea and as I was leaving to go to Douglas <span>(her hairdresser)</span> Mother and Ni came in, their meter showing 10/-!! and they had been driving around Hampstead!!  Not having made an appointment with Miss Worrall I found her engaged of course but got another excellent woman Long by name and she did my hair beautifully.  I then proceeded to the S.P. where I met H and we dressed, arriving at 7 to the Rendezvous in Soho, an odd little Bohemian haunt very full and excellent food, we had a wild and shrieking dinner, all being very bon camarade, and the waiters thought us mad.  Then off we drove in the two taxis to see Peggy, this play is just lately on and I don't know when I laughed more.  We all rolled helplessly back and fore with tears also rolling and really by the end I felt quite tired but what would one expect with Connie Ediss and E Payne playing the fool.  Such a good cast and so clever and smart.  Nowhere but in England can they produce a thing like that, such clever witty songs, such pretty dancing and such lovely colouring.  We then squashed into one taxi, \"very hug\", and ended up our ripping evening at the dear old Carlton of joyous memories.  One never goes there without seeing someone one knows and at the next table to ours sat Frank Roe and Mr Sheepshanks with two ladies, one of which was F.R's wife.

On Sunday \n        14th shortly before midnight the Titanic of the White Star line, the largest \n        ship in the world, struck an iceberg and at 2.30 she sank in 2 miles of \n        water. This was her maiden voyage and she had only been about 4 days at \n        sea. She carried on this occasion 2340 souls, 1635 of these have perished \n        only 705 being saved, the papers are full of the most fearful horrors \n        and for sheer dramatic sensation the scene can hardly have been equalled, \n        nearly all who were saved were women and crew, the latter mostly having \n        been picked up later, there was no confusion or panic and the shock was \n        so slight that some went on playing cards and few realized the danger \n        but it soon dawned in upon them and when the boats drew away taking the \n        few who were saved the wretched remainder must have realized the horror \n        of the situation for she began very soon to sink. We hear that the band \n        lined up and played \"Nearer My God to Thee\" until the water \n        touched their feet, the ships lights were full on almost up to the end, \n        she then broke in two, her machinery was heard to rattle and tear out \n        of her and so with 1600 souls that most splendid invention, \"the \n        last word\" in ship building, went to the bottom. It is all too frightful \n        to realize, she was fitted up with a swimming bath, racquet courts, gymnasium, \n        Palm Courts, private suites which cost \u00a3870 and every sort of luxury \n        man could invent and when one realizes that Nature without the least effort \n        destroyed this work of years in a few hours it does indeed make one feel \n        small. Every day the papers contain fresh tales of heroism and the survivors \n        who were picked up by the Carpathia have arrived in New York so we shall \n        hear more details.

We then \n        drove to the Hyde Park Hotel where we had a most excellent dinner with \n        our dear Grays, it was a very amusing dinner and we laughed a great deal. \n        Carol joined us at about 8 and we all went on to Covent Garden together. \n        The Rheingold was given and I was glad as I have never heard it before. \n        It went on continuously for 3 hours with no break but it seemed all too \n        short. Dr Rottenberg conducted and Kirkby Lunn was singing. Aimee was \n        of the party and we all returned to the flat for supper making a very \n        gay and jolly party.

We were to have had tea at the Skippy's \n        and gone to an entertainment in the Schools but it was too wet and so \n        we shirked both but were fully occupied in writing dozens of letters to \n        innumerable kind friends to thank for presents etc...<br/>\n<span><br/>\n        Letter writing and church took up the next few days.

The children \n        went off to other parties, some becoming rather seedy, no doubt as a result \n        of over indulgence. Wynne's niece, Win (Lees) was kept in, and spent Sunday \n        reading <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Days_of_Pompeii\">\"The Last Days of Pompeii\"</a> \"with her longs legs \n        spread out in front of her!\"</span><br/>\n<b><i><br/>\n        December 31st</i></b><br/>\n        Mother and H went over to lunch at the Grays whilst I stayed at home and \n        prepared for my childrens' party and got Maggie to help me do the string \n        entanglements for the String Hunt, this took us the best part of an hour \n        and we could not of course commence until the kids were dressed and downstairs. \n        The Kavanaghs, Howards, Camerons and Margaret Duffus came and after all \n        the string had been unravelled we played wild games, a new one introduced \n        by the Howards called \"Giggipeg\", most thrilling and entertaining. \n        This evening being the last we sat playing Dummy Bridge till 12.0 when \n        we went out to listen to the bells at Farnham and to let the New Year \n        in.

She was brought chiefly for my inspection, a pretty girl \n        and very much all there. Then Algie and I went off to see \"The Blindness \n        of Virtue\" at the Little Theatre. This is a charming little house \n        consisting solely of ground floor seats and boxes more like a drawing \n        room and the play I thought excellent. We repaired afterwards to the dear \n        old Piccadilly where I have spent so many delightful hours and whilst \n        there I spied Charles Bridge of all people. I made signs to him and over \n        he came, promptly engaging me for dinner. This fixed up I went home, changed \n        rapidly and drove off again to dine at the Berkeley with this mad hatter. \n        It was delightfully refreshing to see him again and we laughed much, but \n        he had little cause to do so really as his man had brought him up word \n        that a man in the guard room had attempted to commit suicide that afternoon \n        and as Charles was orderly officer he had no business in Town at ll. I \n        do hope it'll all blow over. We went on to the Palace afterwards. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>February 29th</b></i><br/>\n        Another full day. H and I set off early and went first to the Stores once \n        more, then took a motor bus to Charing Cross and from thence walked nearly \n        all the way into the City which I loved. What is there about the Strand, \n        Ludgate Circus, Cheapside etc. which fascinates one so? The very air breathes \n        business and order and earnestness. I love it and one is proud to be English \n        when one is in the City. H came as far as Winchester House with me where \n        I met Tom with whom I was to lunch, and he then went off to do so with \n        Charlie Jones. We betook ourselves to Palmerston House just opposite, \n        a huge cavern of a place full of eating holes and offices and a general \n        air of solemnity about it. We sat and ate and talked for an hour and then \n        he walked up as far as the Bank with me where I left him to take a bus \n        to the National Gallery on the steps of which I met H again. We went round \n        this vast place until 4.0 struck and it was closed. I often wonder why \n        one goes abroad to see pictures with this place in our midst. After this \n        we went for another ramble all along the mean streets of St Martin's Lane, \n        Old Compton Street, Wardour Street and other Soho haunts finally fetching \n        up in Dean Street where we had tea at the Rendezvous, a strange Bohemian \n        haunt much in vogue at present. This done we marched home and after an \n        early dinner sallied forth once more to see \"Bella Donna\" which \n        is unpleasant, of course, very, but intensely interesting I thought, and \n        have seen no finer acting. Alexander as the Dr. and Mrs P Campbell as \n        Mrs Chepstow are splendid, but the whole cast is without fault I consider \n        and I was intensely interested. </p>\n</td>"}, "viewer_9": {"order": 9, "title": "Viewer 9", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1912/february/BellaDonna_prog_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><b><span>Playbill for Bella \n        Donna, which Wynne saw on February 29th</span>, \n        <span></span>...</b> </p>\n<p><b>Robert Hichens (1864 - 1950) was a very well known \n        Edwardian writer whose book, \"Bella Donna\", achieved a certain \n        notoriety.

Dark pillars with \n        a terrace at the foot of them, the rostra and steps which latter lead \n        straight down to a space at the foot of the stalls up the centre of which \n        is a broad way left for the players who come up and down it as well as \n        through the sides. All is dark and gloomy and a weird gong sounds and \n        soon the populace come flitting in to the foot of the steps and call for \n        Oedipus - Martin Harvey and Lillian McCarthy are the hero and heroine \n        and for 2 solid hours one sits lost in the wondrous and tragic history \n        of an evil fate - I shall never forget it and whether it is produced correctly \n        or not it will ever remain in my mind as quite the most perfect things \n        of its kind I have ever seen.

The audience sit round the arena which is formed \n        like the floor of a cathedral and in the centre is the throne where on \n        sits the Miraculous Image. <img height=\"340\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1912/january/Miracle_virgin.jpg\" width=\"250\"/>It \n        is the story of a Nun who hearing the call of the world leaves the convent \n        and during her absence the Virgin to shield her descends from her throne \n        and personifies her till she returns.

A proto-rummy game for 2 players.<br/>\n              Deck is 40 cards: A234567JQK<br/>\n              Each receives 10 cards, rest stacked face down.</p>\n<p>Object is to be 1st to go out by melding 11 cards, including the last <br/>\n              one drawn.</p>\n<p>Meld = 3+ matched cards (same rank) or 3-8 cards in sequence.</p>\n<p>Since there are only 10 cards in a suit, and you have to meld 11 to <br/>\n              go out, the longest sequence is 8, because the other 3 cards have to be <br/>\n              a different meld.</p>\n<p>A23 is valid as is 67J, but not QKA.</p>\n<p>Non-dealer starts by turning up top down card. Can't pick it up; must <br/>\n              meld immediately (with at least 2 cards from hand) or pass. If he melds, <br/>\n              must also make a discard face up. If he passes, Dealer has same choice <br/>\n              (meld with it or pass [in this case turning the card face down]).</p>\n<p>Play continues in this way. Whoever turns up a card must either meld it, <br/>\n              add it to an existing meld, or pass. If both pass, second player turns <br/>\n              it down and turns up new card.</p>\n<p>In melding, you can use cards from other melds, as long as all melds <br/>\n              remain legal (i.e. you can take a 6 from a meld of 4 6's to make a <br/>\n              sequence of 456, but you couldn't take it from a meld of only 3 6's). <br/>\n              After melding, your discard is available to the other player, who may <br/>\n              either meld it, or turn it down and turn up a new card.</p>\n<p>Game end when one player melds both the face up card, and all remaining <br/>\n              cards in hand (either by making a new meld or adding to existing or both).</p>\n<p>If a player refuses to take a card that can be legally melded to <br/>\n              existing melds, opponent can demand he do so. In this way a person can <br/>\n              be forced into a situation they can't get out of - one of the main <br/>\n              startegies of the game.</p>\n<p>If neither has gone out when the last available card has been declined, <br/>\n              the game is a draw.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_7": {"order": 7, "title": "Viewer 7", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1912/july/RHAuniforms_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"435\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"365\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1912/july/AldershotDay.jpg\" width=\"435\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><b><i>The souvenir booklet issued to the Canadians \n        when they visited Aldershot.

We drove up to Camp first of all with \n        the men and whilst they were in office we strolled away up into the brushwood \n        and sat about reading till 1.0 . Well, we gathered in Major Ward there \n        who returned to lunch with us and then we started off to go to Bettwsycoed \n        via Beddgelert, we passed through that perfect place the Vale of Aberglaslyn \n        over the Bridge where we got down and took photos and then on through \n        Beddgelert all along the Aberglaslyn Vale. Up above us towered Snowdon, \n        down below the river ran through green and sleepy pastures, whilst several \n        lakes increased the perfection of it all. At length we arrived at Bettwsycoed, \n        the surrounding country couldn't be more glorious but the place itself \n        is now such a \"Resort\" that its really spoilt with hundreds \n        of tourists, their cars and their necessary hotels. We returned by a higher \n        road over the Roman Bridge and past the Roman Tower, and our way ran up \n        up up into the wilds of the mountain top. We gradually rose from 444feet \n        to 1063 feet: the view was splendid, and how strange and lonely it was \n        right up there in that far away spot with nothing but the sheep and a \n        lonely farmstead here and there. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>June 2nd</b></i><br/>\n        This day we set forth upon our tour within a tour, and at 11.30 we were \n        on our way to Chester. The fog settled down on us and the rain, it was \n        almost dark and we couldn't see 6 yards ahead, but the spirits of the \n        party kept us going, we arrived in the quaintest of quaint towns at about \n        6.0 and ate a huge tea, it was too wet to go out so we just changed and \n        soon had dinner - a large and most excellent Hotel full of Americans, \n        called the Grosvenor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>June 3rd</b></i><br/>\n        What a strange and unique town. We all went forth exploring in different \n        directions, and were fascinated by it all. The famous Rows took up a deal \n        of our attention, a double row of shops one above another on each side \n        of the street with a gallery running along - funny old over hanging half-timbered \n        houses stretched out over the street as if to shake hands, and many side \n        alleys so narrow that they almost met. We saw \"God's Providence\" \n        house, the only one spared during plague time, and Bishop Lloyd's wonderful \n        house with its beautiful old windows and carved beams. <br/>\n        We left again at 12.0 and lunched at one of the oldest coaching inns in \n        existence, the Bridgewater Arms, a delightfully clean place, arriving \n        at tea time at the Raven, Shrewsbury.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span>The party returned to base the next day, having \n        covered 225 miles, which Wynne proudly noted.

Thank god Mother \n        wasn't hurt nor he, but the car was matches and she had to come back by \n        tram to Surbiton and get a train.

The air was full of shouted orders and \n        being so still we could hear every word. When the order to start firing \n        was given, round after round was fired and the effect was grand. The flashes \n        at the guns, the shells bursting in the far distance looking like small \n        powder puffs and the wonderful roar as they rushed unseen through the \n        air. Every hill echoed and rang with the sound and it all gave me the \n        feeling as if I wanted to cry! When all was ended they assembled for the \n        pow-wow, the guns rumbled home and in the stillness caused by this absence \n        no sound came up to us except the men's' voices and the chinking of the \n        horses bits as they waited about to take the officers home. At length \n        we all left and the valley was once more given up to its original calm. \n        What must the spirits of the men of Stone Age and Roman times be thinking \n        of such strange proceedings?</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"489\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"305\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1912/may/Artillery.jpg\" width=\"489\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><br/>\n<span>What indeed - this entry reminds me so much \n        of Hardy's poem, \"Channel Firing\", written in April 1914 with \n        ominous prescience.

After breakfast \n      to Church we all went except the two Grannies and then after lunch we set \n      to with feverish haste to decorate the tree and arrange the tables, such \n      a collection of things to distribute and so many secrets right up to the \n      last minute.

According to custom \n      the youngest in the house enters first after the bell is rung and so the \n      dear Blokey who came over with the Skippys and Capt Master proudly marched \n      in ahead and rushed to the Tree as fast as her 18 month old legs could carry \n      her. There followed all our crew. Dear old Gran was wheeled in before and \n      sat beside her table of presents taking the liveliest interest in all and \n      looking very sweet. Then came the servants, the men and their wives and \n      children and in all we numbered 32! We then distributed all their presents \n      and the things off the Tree. It was a perfectly shaped one this year and \n      looked particularly lovely with the coloured balls, silver wreaths, crackers, \n      candles and the silver strands of angels' hair falling like rain all over \n      it. H and I got some lovely presents amongst others Mother gave me a sweet \n      set of corals, also her lovely emerald and diamond earrings and old paste \n      brooch to match. Just for remembrance sake I must mention too a blue morocco \n      despatch case and cigarette holder from the Grays and H a copper and brass \n      Thibetan <span>(sic)</span> \"lazy stand\" and \n      painted china from Mother, besides heaps of other things so we were very \n      lucky.

Scott's poor wife is on her way to New \n      Zealand to meet him as she believes and cannot hear the news till she gets \n      there, its all too tragic. Capt. Scott's record is most wonderfully calm \n      and resigned. Of course he knew as he wrote it that he would shortly die \n      and those with him, a fearful situation. Capt. Oates who was desperately \n      ill left the party deliberately earlier and went out into the blizzard to \n      die as he knew he was retarding their progress, what strength of character. \n      The record says they found Amundsen's tent and records at the Pole and left \n      their own there, one wonders what is the use of it all and one only only \n      hopes that death under the circumstances comes mercifully. </td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1913/february/RussianBalletProg_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><b><i>Wynne adored the famous Russian Ballet - she \n        had been before, but this programme was special - she was able to see \n        the fabled male dancer, Nijinksy, and some of the other stars, most notably \n        Tamara Karsavina. <br/>\n        This was the group brought over by Diaghilev which had caused such a storm \n        in Paris. </i></b></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"495\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"1493\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1913/february/Ballet1.jpg\" width=\"495\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"495\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"915\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1913/february/Ballet2.jpg\" width=\"495\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_6": {"order": 6, "title": "Viewer 6", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n<p><span>February 13th - 18th</span></p>\n<p>At home in Farnham, near Aldershot, and \n              carrying on with her army duties.\n              A bad head cold is about to start. </p>\n\n\n", "description": "<td> <b></b><br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>February 13th, Thursday</b></i><br/>\n      Last night I went to the first of the Lenten services at St Marks, just \n      to see if I should be inspired by the preacher but alas he was just the \n      usual youthful pogbag who could aspire no further than platitudes and I \n      doubt me if I'll go again!

We lunched at Rendezvous \n        and went afterwards to see \"Hello Ragtime\" at the Hippo, a typically \n        modern production and rather clever. I had to leave before the end however \n        as WT was due with me at tea. Tonight I had great fun. I took a party \n        of 6 to Lady Fulton's dance at the Ritz.

The church at Stow has \n      been much restored and I didn't care for it, and the Rector keeps the churchyard \n      in a horribly neglected condition.

Germany has sent an ultimatum to Russia to the effect that if she \n        does not cease to mobilize by noon today she (Germany) will also mobilize, \n        of course the reply is a foregone conclusion. Knowing that provisions \n        are likely to be scarce and go up in price I set about ordering in an \n        increased quantity today and got them all. ES and I also went down to \n        Aldershot to the Stores. There we found confusion worse confounded, people \n        feverishly ordering in all sorts of food stuffs and the men said they \n        would have to work all tomorrow as they could not keep pace with the orders. \n        Our intention was to purchase flour. ES wanted 70lbs and I 50lbs. At first \n        the man said he'd book it and forward it in the course of a day or so. \n        Not so, said we, we'll take it away with us and I personally paid for \n        mine there and then. It had already gone up 2d on the 12lbs. I also invested \n        in tinned goods and potted meats and tongues and on my return had a consultation \n        with Mrs Bacon who went down afterwards and purchased for me a ham. I \n        also got her to get me a \u00a310 note changed to gold whilst Swansborough \n        did the same for me as I hear that soon we shall even find it difficult \n        to get gold. In France it is already almost unprocurable and today Bank \n        Rate in England has risen to 10% and the Stock Exchange is closed. I think \n        so much of my dear man and wonder exactly where he is. I don't know his \n        address but got a line from Town written last night saying he would send \n        it soon. <span>(The currency was still on the gold \n        standard, and some of the coinage was still gold - notably sovereigns, \n        which were \u00a31 coins. This is what Wynne was sending out for. There \n        were 12 pennies to a shilling, and twenty shillings to a pound - in other \n        words, 240 pennies in each pound. A penny bought a great deal then. As \n        you can see in the cutting oppositie, the Government soon acted, but they \n        did not bring in rationing, and this was to cause great suffering later \n        in the War).<br/>\n        .</span><br/>\n<i><b>August 2nd, Sunday</b></i><br/>\n        Everyone is most kind and sympathetic. Mrs Fitz asked me to tea and Mrs \n        Newcome to lunch but I feel somehow as if I couldn't go out and prefer \n        to stay at home. When we got down to Church the news reached us that Germany \n        has declared war against Russia. That means France will follow immediately \n        and indeed hostilities have already commenced on both the Russian and \n        French frontiers of Germany. It is an inconceivable thought. Mr Bacon, \n        the Naval Reserve one, has received his orders and left this afternoon, \n        and Skippy is hourly expecting his. Everyone is overwhelmed with the paralyzing \n        thought of what it all means and one thinks of nothing else all day and \n        night. I bicycled down to Farnham to try and get a decent Sunday paper \n        but could get nothing but rags.

The wildest rumours are afloat, and \n        everyone is filled with vague alarms. I heard this morning from my man \n        who gave me his address and I was able to write to him but he is far afield \n        and goodness knows when he will get the letters. One goes about with a \n        restless haunted feeling all day, most terrible things are happening abroad \n        and all telephonic communication is cut off between us and the continent. \n        Germany has invaded the neutral state of Luxembourg and this evening has \n        it that she has entered Belgium!<br/>\n</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"168\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"633\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/august/Aug4clipping.jpg\" width=\"168\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><br/>\n<i><b>August 4th</b></i><br/>\n        Germany has declared war against France.

Mrs Bacon came in this morning and we had a talk together. \n        Mrs Skippy came and we gloomed together and then after lunch <span>(went) \n        </span>down into the town. I went to the station to enquire about Herbert's \n        sword that has got lost and found there swarms of Reservists both arriving \n        and departing, the station a mass of men, many alas only too well \"treated\" \n        by their friends and heaps of women and children seeing them off. Well \n        the die is cast. Germany rejected our Note about Belgium whose territory \n        she is now invading and so today War has been declared.

The German army is slowly but surely \n        and with heavy losses engulfing poor Liege which is making a brave resistance. \n        I went down with ES to the Town to make some store purchases for Skippy, \n        a strange scene it was, all our friends there in uniform of course, with \n        their wives trying to make last purchases, the shops a seething mass of \n        people laying in provisions and the shelves and counters getting more \n        and more bare. The Camp presented a strange unwonted sight, masses of \n        reservists being inspected in their new kit, piles of baggage and kit \n        lying about and lines upon lines of horses. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>August 7th</b></i><br/>\n        The news today is that the Germans are within the forts of Liege, how \n        terrible it is. I heard from H last night, they are full of alarms and \n        excursions, wild rumours and constant wires but how thankful I am that \n        my beloved is not to leave the country, so far at least, for it will indeed \n        be awful when they are all gone. Nearer and nearer the dread day approaches. \n        Blanche Gray writes the Major goes this day week but I have not heard \n        any definite dates for any of our troops here yet. I have filled my day \n        with trivial tasks, it is the only way to keep our mind from distraction \n        for if one thinks one can no longer bear it. I am so lucky getting letters \n        from H, so often, so much luckier than these others will be, poor things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>August 8th, Saturday</b></i><br/>\n        The report of the fall of Liege has been contradicted today and wild rumours \n        arrive instead of wholesale surrender and losses on the German side. An \n        armistice of 24 hours was asked for but the Belgians refused. They have \n        put up a wonderful resistance and it must indeed be a surprise to the \n        Kaiser and his Invincibles, but all sorts of rumours come to hand and \n        one doesn't know what to believe. A very wise move is that there is to \n        be a Government source of news for the Press in future with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._E._Smith,_1st_Earl_of_Birkenhead\">F.E.Smith</a> at its head in order that all news which comes to hand may be authenticated, \n        a very strict censor on all letters will be in force, and the utmost care \n        that information does not leak through. S.A. has taught us a lot through \n        our hapless mistakes of that time. I went over the way after dinner and \n        she is with me most of the day which is so nice. We can be together. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>August 9th, Sunday</b></i><br/>\n        Our Service today was one of Intercession, special Psalms, Lessons and \n        Hymns. Mr Douglas preached very well and read a long letter from the Bishop \n        and we ended by singing the National Anthem. It was all very sad but beautiful, \n        the men (soldier men I mean) were conspicuous by their absence alas! all \n        being on duty. Being Sunday no papers of course. I got a Lloyd in the \n        evening but one cannot believe anything these rags say and I must await \n        tomorrow's Times. I heard from my dear man last night, he says his letters \n        soon will probably be read by the censor so I may not hear again for a \n        day or two. ES came with us up to Caesar's Camp after lunch, and all was \n        activity and stir, men exercising everywhere, on the plain, at the ranges \n        etc. so unlike the usual Sunday. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>August 10th, Monday</b></i><br/>\n        ES took me and all the children down to the Town this morning and we did \n        various shopping and business.

I \n        went this afternoon to a little Intercession Service at the Chapel, very \n        short, simple and pathetic, and the congregation was made up mainly of \n        wives and mothers. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/august/LatestNewsAug10_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"349\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"735\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/august/LatestNews_large.jpg\" width=\"349\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_6": {"order": 6, "title": "Viewer 6", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n<p>August 11th - 17th</p>\n<p>Dramatic departure of the British Expeditionary \n              Force, \"almost like a phantom army\".

This war seems worse somehow than \n        S.A. but thank God one has complete confidence in the steadyness and fitness \n        of our troops and their wonderful organization. I spent the afternoon \n        in Aldershot with the Skippys, everything seems to have an air of finality, \n        in camp all is ready, many have gone and the 11th Co.

I got up at 5.30 and \n        an hour later went over to see Skippy off because I felt perhaps it was \n        less desolate for her than to be alone. The rain comes down in torrents \n        and it is grey and cold. What can one say or feel at such a time. No one \n        can describe the sense of loss that hangs over us all. I feel so thankful \n        that the Good God has spared me this for though my man is away and so \n        far away its not like this horror. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>August 16th, Sunday</b></i><br/>\n        To Kirk with ES and Aim and to sleep \"the rest of the day\", \n        an unutterable feeling of deathly staleness is over one.

The French and Germans \n        have had their first encounters and it is believed their huge armies will \n        soon be in more general touch. Our force has left in a most dramatic way \n        to my way of thinking, the whole thing has melted away into the unknown, \n        even at the hour of embarkation not a man knew his destination, and not \n        a paper has so much as mentioned the fact that one single soldier has \n        left for the Front. How different from the times of the S.A. when an army \n        of the Press rushed out, hosts of useless women and endless mistakes were \n        the order of the day.

Day by day War news gets more and more thrilling \n        and our men are so much in our thoughts. I cannot understand the German \n        tactics, though from all accounts (which may be lies) they are most brutal, \n        burning villages, killing all the people and utterly destroying all - \n        it seems most dreadful in the 20th century. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>August 20th</b></i><br/>\n        The Germans are nearing Brussels, poor people how panic stricken they \n        must be, crowds of refugees come pouring in whilst hundreds are leaving \n        for Ghent and Ostend etc. it is no use, the hoards will over run all sooner \n        or later. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>August 21st, Friday</b></i><br/>\n<i>Universal Day of Intercession</i><br/>\n        Every day is filled with the thoughts of our precious handful of men over \n        the Channel and one wonders indeed what is happening to them for no news \n        filters through. So far the Belgiums and French have had it all their \n        own way but it is nothing these losses to the German hoards. The Mad Dog \n        doesn't care how many are sacrificed but I think the delay they have been \n        caused will put them out somewhat. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>August 22nd</b></i><br/>\n        The Germans have entered Brussels and a huge tax has been levied upon \n        the city also upon the province and town of Liege, this article from tonight's \n        Globe is not flattering, how a German's blood must boil to read such a \n        thing. Went down into Farnham with ES and then on to the Bacons to discuss \n        work. Layettes for officers' wives is our job. <span>(Layette: \n        clothes etc for a newborn child).</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>August 23rd, Sunday</b></i><br/>\n        Luckily we got a Sunday Times today, a great joy, and I've read it from \n        start to finish. The latest is that Japan is about to declare war with \n        Germany as no reply has been given to their Ultimatum. Meanwhile the Russian \n        hoard creeps on and Austria has had another warship sunk in the Adriatic \n        and a severe defeat by the Servians at Nish. German troops are expected \n        at Ghent and Bruges and Ostend are said to be in panic. The Belgium Government \n        have withdrawn to Antwerp which is strongly fortified and German troops \n        are advancing on Lille. The papers are full of fearful horrors. God grant \n        they are not true. We all went up to Bourley after tea, a perfect evening, \n        and as one strolled along that peaceful spot one could not realize that \n        War is in the very air, it seemed impossible until the fact was forced \n        upon one's mind my the word \"halt\", and there stood a sentry \n        guarding the water reservoir from would be poisoners. We found some white \n        heather which is a sign of good luck and some is going to the Front. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>August 24th</b></i><br/>\n        ES and I went down into Farnham this morning to purchase the materials \n        for our baby linen which we are making the officers' families fund. At \n        4.0 I took the children to the Intercession Service, poor pathetic congregation \n        of wives and mothers and relatives, and such a long list of men were read \n        out. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_9": {"order": 9, "title": "Viewer 9", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/august/Generals_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<b><span>The Army leaders who were to dominate the \n        first year of the war: Kitchener, Sir John French and Roberts at the top, \n        Haig, Hamilton and Smith Dorrien at the bottom...</span></b><span>the family were closest to Roberts, who was an old friend, but they knew Smith Dorrien well too, and their respective children sometimes played together, much to the Jackson children's displeasure! </span></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"383\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"474\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/august/Generals_large.jpg\" width=\"383\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Wynne added another picture to her diary later, stuck \n        into the August 26th page.

I think Beyers a particularly interesting character. </p>\n<p>General Beyers had been a Boer commander, and he favoured passive resistance when the war started, but was overruled by De Wet. Beyers resigned his commission in the army when the government decided to invade South West Africa.

Mother and Win came down on the 23rd in the kind Skippy's motor. Our Xmas went off outwardly as usual. I made no difference for the children's sake but it was a sickening feeling for me and I was thankful when it was over, how could one rejoice and sing Peace on Earth etc. when there is nothing but strife and ill will throughout so many lands and so many are in mourning. However the children and servants enjoyed the usual festivities and the dear Skippys came to dinner to which all the children sat up. I thought much of my dear thing for this is the first Xmas we have been absent one from another. Better times will come doubtless but meanwhile its hard to be brave. I sent no cards this year and got very few. One did not miss them and really to go wishing people A Merry Xmas seemed absurd.

Monday and Tuesday were spent in answering letters and sending parcels to my men and on Wed 30th as I was sitting writing a letter to Mabel I suddenly got this wire from H, it was then 4.15 and at 5.0 he arrived!! The whole house suddenly went mad! We all rushed about getting his room ready which was full of soldiers' clothes and at 5.0 there he actually was. What I felt I simply cannot describe, I've certainly never been so glad to see anyone before, and he is looking so well. It is a joy, such a ripping treat to have him back and we just sat and talked and talked till all hours, there was so much to hear and tell. He has brought home 3 cartridge, a French, English and German, also two neat little Pom Pom shells from his aircraft gun which being useless has gone back to store! Another trophy was a box of matches bought at Ypres! Here also is the King and Queen's Xmas card to the troops, also those of the Rawlinsons to the 7th and 8th Division and one from a Flying Corps to H, all interesting mementos of these times. H has much to tell and its all so awfully interesting to hear it first hand. he tells us that Xmas Day was spent on their line in complete peace. There was an early service in a little house to which a lot of them went, and during the morning an officer mending a telegraph wire called out a Happy Xmas to a German he happened to see, who immediately came out of his trench followed by all the others and our men and they fraternised and hobnobbed all day long having lit up their trenches with lights and Xmas trees in some places. this peace with them was kept up all next day and then of course it all began again, how weird it seems that one day they should shake hands and exchange comforts and the next day shoot as many of each other as possible. There seems so little personal feeling against each other.</p>\n<p><em><strong>December 31st</strong></em><br/>\n        On this day the last of the year the whole family went to Town and actually did 2 Pantomimes in one day. The kind Duke sent Mother a whole heap of boxes and we had a large party for Drury Lane. It was a splendid show as usual, Sleeping Beauty for the 3rd time but just as amusing. Then Mother took Baby home whilst we and the Elliots went on to the Waldorf Hotel for food and then the Aldwych for Cinderella, getting home at 11.30. Our sleepy children were asleep at once and we just sat the Old Year out, this year which will never be forgotten and as the bells and hooters rang in the new, one was glad to think 1914 was dead though we've had good times in it nevertheless and much has happened.<br/>\n        Goodbye. </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_11": {"order": 11, "title": "Viewer 11", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/december/XmasCard_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"490\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"694\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/december/XmasCards.jpg\" width=\"490\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><a href=\"../../section_pages/christmas/strip.html\" target=\"diary\">For more about Christmases in the diary, check out the special section.<br/>\n</a><span>The card from the King and Queen mentioned is shown in the last window of this section.      </span></p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}}, "errors": [], "description": "\n\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n<p><span>Wynne has been keeping her diaries since 1895. \n  She manages her daily chores, but is finding diary writing increasingly difficult </span></p>\n\n\n"}, "february": {"viewers": {"viewer_1": {"order": 1, "title": "Viewer 1", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/february/Parsifalprogramme_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><b>The programme for the production of Parsifal that \n        Wynne saw on February 10th </b></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"496\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"735\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/february/ParsifalProg_new.jpg\" width=\"496\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_2": {"order": 2, "title": "Viewer 2", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n<p>February 1st - 6th</p>\n<p>A week of duties, lovely weather, and the \n              making of a \"Spring Pie\". </p>\n\n\n", "description": "<td> <b></b><br/>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"328\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"142\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/february/FebruaryHeader.jpg\" width=\"328\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<br/>\n<b></b><br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>February 1st, Sunday</b></i><br/>\n      Why seaweed and fishes as a heading for February, mad, and nothing to do \n      with the case.

To Town by the 11.0 and to Parsifal \n        this evening! We got out at Vauxhall and to my consternation I found my \n        box hadn't been put out! We waited there half an hour, telephoning, to \n        no avail, so I went to the flat and H on to Waterloo, no box - they then \n        wired to every station we had stopped at and drew blank. He then returned \n        and as at 3.30 no sign of it was forthcoming we went off to Peter Jones, \n        I to buy a \"reach me down\" and he a shirt for all his were in \n        my box. I was just paying for it and he had bought his shirt when we got \n        a phone message from Mother to say the box had arrived! so P.J. let me \n        off my purchase and we hurriedly returned. I believe they had it at Waterloo \n        all the time, it wasn't locked and had all my jewelry in it. Hastily dressing \n        we hurried after Mother and BG for the performance began at 5.0, and arrived \n        there at about 5.30 finding Aim, Col. Sandilands and Onslow Ford assembled. \n        It lasted from 5.0 until 11.30 and seemed all too short, at 7.0 we had \n        a break of an hour and a half and the whole house turned out for dinner \n        whilst we had ours comfortably in the drawing room at the back of the \n        box. Sandwiches and cakes of all sorts, champagne and whiskey and soda! \n        Then at 10.0 there was another break of half an hour. The music and the \n        scenery were both absolutely perfect - Bodanzky conducted and his orchestra \n        did indeed do him credit. The scenery by Harker took a year to paint and \n        the panorama is said to be an eighth of a mile long. It was all beautiful, \n        sublime and grand and I shall never forget it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>Feb 11th</b></i><br/>\n        I am almost ashamed to confess that last night after the most solemn performance \n        of Parsifal Col. Sandilands took H and me off to the Automobile Club where \n        we had an excellent supper and from the sublime to the ridiculous we witnessed \n        the latest thing in tangos! The very latest! also other dancing and singing \n        with which it is customary to amuse restaurant guests now-a-days whilst \n        they languidly refresh themselves after a strenuous evening at the Theatre \n        or Music Hall. We did a good deal of shopping today and Thurie came to \n        lunch whilst Col Daniels and the Fultons looked in for tea, the latter \n        are just home from a trip abroad. We went out afterwards to a very good \n        show at the Chelsea Palace. We amused ourselves very well there and there \n        were some extremely clever turns, H laughing till he cried!

There we dug out the Camerons and actually skated till lunch, \n        it was lovely and such a lovely silver and white world, every leaf and \n        twig glistened in the sun with hoar frost and everything looked dressed \n        in silver. After lunch I read at the Home and walked up to Charman to \n        buy flowers which are scarce and very dear, and on my return home I found \n        Gen. Davis who had walked over to tea, he is a very interesting and nice \n        little man of great ability and an interesting career. To dinner came \n        the Lawsons, Huttons, Majors MacCarthy and Seagram - all new people save \n        the Ls whose last night it was in the command and we were proud they should \n        spend it with us. They go tomorrow and we shall miss them much. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>January 24th, Saturday</b></i><br/>\n        There has been 16 degrees of frost this morning, the sun shined brilliantly \n        all day and everything looked lovely. The frost flowers this morning on \n        the windows were like huge branches of palms, really wonderful and these \n        things are always a mystery to me. We set off at 2.30 today and went down \n        in the Skippy's car to the station to see the Lawsons off. There we found \n        assembled a host of people also a band of buglers of the Oxfords. The band \n        played on the platform, then the buglers blew the salute and as the train \n        moved off the band played Auld Lang Syne and the Gen. hung out of the \n        window waving his hat till out of sight, it was all rather touching and \n        we shall miss these nice kind people very much. She is a most gracious \n        lady, such charming manners and so good to look at and he so hospitable \n        and genial, their place will be hard to fill. I asked her about Gran's \n        wire from the King on her birthday which she had said she would put through \n        for me and she said she would be sure to remember but she is such a busy \n        lady that I half fear she may forget! </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_9": {"order": 9, "title": "Viewer 9", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/january/Fashion_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<span><i><b>Some fashion plates Wynne put into her \n        diary for this year...</b></i></span></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"392\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"207\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/january/Fashion1.jpg\" width=\"392\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"373\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"281\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/january/Fashion2.jpg\" width=\"373\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_10": {"order": 10, "title": "Viewer 10", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n<p><span>January 25th - 31st</span></p>\n<p>More colds, but the weather improves.

I was rather tried this afternoon by a Cafe Chantant \n        to which I had to go by request of Mrs Fitzroy, I went down at 3.15 and \n        sat there till 6.0 listening to various performers of mediocre quality, \n        then I came home, dressed and we set off to dine with the Hakings. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>January 30th</b></i><br/>\n        We have had most disquieting news of poor Willie <span>(Herbert's \n        brother?)</span>, a sudden illness, an operation and the discovery of \n        an internal abcess broken so that they fear complications.

We had to change at Steinach for R is on a small primitive \n        loop line. The train laboured on its way puffing and panting as though \n        it \"had bones in its legs\" and the track was covered with grass. \n        At last we came to Rothenburg and having been advised by the porter (fool) \n        at Innsbruck to go to Hotel Wilbad we accordingly did so. We were much \n        annoyed to find it right outside the town down the hill, a great rambling \n        new hotel with only about 2 other people in it besides ourselves. We had \n        quite a nice bedroom with a balcony and a bathroom attached but as the \n        water in the latter was always cold we didn't benefit much and it also \n        was so fearfully brackish the soap wouldn't lather! <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>July 3rd</b></i><br/>\n        Early this morning we packed up our goods and leaving them to be sent \n        to the station started off to explore the town. It is a most wonderful \n        old place, far more interesting to my mind than Nurnberg which now is \n        so over grown. There is not a single modern touch here and anyone wishing \n        to build a house must apply to the authorities and build it in the old \n        style and with materials supplied from the town authorities who place \n        their brick and tiles in the open for months in order to get them weather-stained. \n        Very quaint are the narrow streets, the purely medieval houses of old \n        red brick and half timber walls all leaning together and clinging to one \n        another. Huge walls and towers surround the town with a deep fosse running \n        all round. Window boxes are much in vogue each house a perfect hanging \n        garden of colour, and how fascinating is the old Rathaus built in 1240 \n        and partially burnt down in 1501 when that part was replaced by the Renaissance \n        portion one now sees. We roamed all over it and went into the archives \n        underground and again underneath them the grim sad prisons where it is \n        said their famous Burgermeister Topler was poisoned and thrown there to \n        die by the citizens on account of treason. These prisons reminded me of \n        those in the Tower of London, just square holes really with heavy doors, \n        no light and no means of ventilation even, a grim place but times were \n        rough in those days. <br/>\n<span>(Wynne then went on to detail some local historical \n        events, before describing catching a train out of the Tyrol and up to \n        Herrnberchtheim, from where a coach and horses awaited them to take them \n        to Frankenberg. They had arranged to stay with their von Poellnitz relations.)</span><br/>\n        All my life I had longed to go to this house of my ancestors, about which \n        one had heard so much, but as we drove up the steep hill leading to the \n        castle and into the courtyard we both felt much embarrassed and frightened \n        for we had never met them both and had so little German!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>July 4th, Saturday.<a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Frankenberg\"> Frankenberg</a>. </b></i><br/>\n        My entry of yesterday having already exceeded its limit by far, I felt \n        I must leave off to begin another day! Well it was about 4.0 when we arrived \n        yesterday and were met by Theodor and Annie Poellnitz, the first greetings \n        over we were shown our room which is an octagonal one in the left hand \n        tower with a sitting room attached, the walls of the castle are an enormous \n        thickness, room enough to sit and write in them, the floors are all parquet \n        in pattern and the walls panelled. Everywhere is lovely old furniture, \n        books, china curiousities and from the walls looks down the portraits \n        of many ancestors, an ugly lot for the most part! We then had tea and \n        afterwards took a walk all through the woods and round the walls and at \n        8.0 had supper consisting of soup, meat and savoury. They have their dinner \n        in the middle of the day and don't dress in the evening. Theodor is a \n        very genial amusing fellow and his wife is nice looking and not stout \n        like so many German ladies and is most amiable and hospitable. They have \n        one daughter of 16, Marie Mathilde, a typical fat pleasant German girl, \n        and there is also a governess and a lady friend whose name I haven't caught. \n        The Poellnitz came here in 1738, the property being given to them by the \n        Margrave of Ausbach whose portrait and that of his wife hang in the drawing \n        room. Alas that Theodor has no son, the place at his death goes to Wolfgang \n        Poellnitz who is unmarried and after that what becomes of it goodness \n        knows. It is sad to think it may pass into other hands. Last night soon \n        after our walk in the woods it began to rain very heavily and by supper \n        time it had developed into a thunderstorm, the noise was tremendous and \n        the country below was lit up frequently by vivid flashes of lightening. \n        All night long it continued and to our chagrin all today until about 6.0 \n        but the day was spent in exploring the Castle and we wandered with such \n        interest through all the rooms and then into the dungeons and prisons \n        and cellars. Underneath all these there is a vast water cellar into which \n        we were to have gone but we found that the water in it had risen to the \n        level of its roof and beyond and Theodor said he had never known it do \n        that before. On the wall of one passage a woman's stone mask with open \n        mouth is fixed and it is said that one was buried alive there. One prison \n        evidently intended for solitary confinement or for those considered dangerous \n        has the slit for communication placed so that gaoler and prisoner cannot \n        see one another. No light and double doors and during the recent arrangements \n        for laying on water and light T found an oubliette in the roof of it. \n        Anny showed us many relics and treasure, every drawer is stuffed with \n        them: one had gloves long suede and chamois leather printed and stamped \n        with flowers, another was filled with silk and embroidered men's' garters, \n        \"L'amour est dans vos yeux\" was woven into one white brocade \n        pair. In another drawer we found silk for embroidery, fine floss stuff \n        and yards of hand made trimming for dresses. Oh! how I longed to sit there \n        all day and examine it all alone. Then we saw all the pathetic and sad \n        remains of \"Die unvergesslichen Julia\" - she was the wife of \n        a long ago Poellnitz who died within a year of her marriage at the birth \n        of her son and her husband kept every little thing, all tied up in paper \n        packets and inscribed, even to a drop of blood on a piece of cambric where \n        perhaps she pricked her finger. Then we saw the two historic gloves, one \n        presented by the present Emperor of Austria with some ribbon and a piece \n        of edelweiss to Tante Lotte, my grandfather's sister who reigned in a \n        stately fashion at Frankenberg and left so many debts that Theodor is \n        still paying them off. She married our cousin Fritz and was a grande dame \n        and had an enormous family. The other glove was given by Prince Albert \n        at his wedding with Queen Victoria to Ernst Poellnitz, my great uncle \n        who came over as one of his gentlemen.<br/>\n        After tea we walked down to the old farm on which are employed Russians \n        and Poles throughout the summer, whose only accommodation is one room \n        for women and one for men and in winter they go back to their homes. We \n        visited the stables where 49 huge cows live all year round, horses, pigs \n        and the huge treadmill wheel worked by men for drawing the water, and \n        then we plunged through a sea of mud to their Wirthaus and home up through \n        the fields. After supper Maide (the daughter) played on the harmonica \n        to us, she is very musical and played the piano too. Whilst on a pleasant \n        tune on the former instrument I saw Theodor say something rapidly to her \n        and suddenly the tune changed to God Save the King whereat we promptly \n        stood up and were greeted by roars of laughter from the family. At 9.30 \n        drinks are brought in and we sup up much beer to our contentment! And \n        so to bed, alas. I wish the time were not so short, I should like to stay \n        here a week - perhaps one day we will return who knows, but by then I \n        must become a professor in German. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_3": {"order": 3, "title": "Viewer 3", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/july/Schloss_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><b>Below is a photo of Theodor and Annie von Poellnitz, \n        Wynne's relations whom she visited in July just before the outbreak of \n        war.

We \n        put up at the White Horse Inn, an indifferent hostelry kept by independent \n        folk and very expensive. We went to our house agents to find they only \n        had 3 for us. We rushed off to Trimley and saw a pretty farm house, much \n        too small, and in the afternoon made a weary journey to Aldborough and \n        saw an atrocity at Thorpeness, no use at all. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>July 7th</b></i><br/>\n        We made another lengthy expedition today to Harleston, this time the house \n        was an old one, a very nice interior but bad garden and no sun inside, \n        so that's no use and we journeyed up to Town putting up at Liverpool Street \n        Hotel.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><i>July 8th.

Aime left yesterday having \n        been here a month and has looked after everything so well for me and endeared \n        herself to all. We went and spent the day with Mother, found her in bed \n        of course as she is undergoing a cure with Rabey, he came some time ago \n        and set her ankle and both knees and strapped them up and she has to be \n        in bed a month but she is very cheery, sees plenty of friends, plays bridge \n        and we have great hopes of this cure. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>July 9th</b></i><br/>\n        It seems so strange to be back in England again and to think that our \n        lovely tour for which we waited 13 years is all over.

As there have been \n        various cases of scarlet fever and diptheria lately I thought it best \n        not to risk having my babies about and H took them up to the zoo for the \n        whole day!<br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>July 24th</b></i><br/>\n        I have secured a cook!

Mrs Dew is most satisfactory, \n        an excellent cook, and if it wasn't for the baby I'd stick to her but \n        I want someone to sleep in the house. I had all the Yolland girls to tea \n        today here, poor little creatures, but it is splendid to see the wonders \n        Sister Margaret does with them. I think not to be straight of limb is \n        one of the most fearful afflictions, one child today with both feet turned \n        in and paralized hands, so cheerful and patient. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_7": {"order": 7, "title": "Viewer 7", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/july/EmpManifesto_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><b>Wynne's entry for July 30th.</b> <strong>The blow has fallen.

Our thoughts are more and more directed \n        towards hapless Ireland these days. All this year the crisis has become \n        nearer and nearer, the Govt. have proved unable to cope with the Home \n        Rule question, and at last the King called a conference which after two \n        days has proved a failure. Affairs are at a deadlock and it is impossible \n        to see a way out. Civil War seems inevitable and its all dreadful, and \n        now chiefly on account of the murder of the Austrian Archduke, Austria \n        is at loggerheads with Servia having delivered an ultimatum which they \n        are not able to accept in which case \"War\" is probable and what \n        can the result of that be but a general conflagration?<br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>July 26th</b></i><br/>\n        The Sunday papers have it that Servia has refused Austria's note so that \n        the Austrian Ambassador has left Belgrade. The King and Court have left \n        it too and it is being evacuated by the garrison! What times we live in, \n        and how is it all to end? The Hoopers and Grays came to see us today, \n        the latter having come all the way from Amesbury. It was so jolly to see \n        them again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>July 27th</b></i><br/>\n        As we opened the papers this morning we read of the first bloodshed in \n        Ireland. The cause is more gun running, only this time in Dublin, and \n        on the Nationalist side in open defiance and broad daylight. Consequently \n        the police and military were called out, a frightful row resulted and \n        4 were killed and many injured. It's just awful. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>July 28th</b></i><br/>\n        There is naturally an awful upset over the Irish question. Redmond and \n        Birrell denouncing the Govt in the House on account of the business in \n        Dublin, the troops having fired on the mob who attacked them on their \n        way back to barracks. Mr Harrel the man in the police who is held responsible \n        for calling the soldiers out is suspended and Sir John Ross Head of Police \n        has resigned. <span>(David Harrel was Assistant to \n        the Commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, Sir J Ross)</span>. \n        The Govt. seems powerless to keep order or maintain the law and things \n        are more complicated than ever. Meanwhile the clouds are gathering abroad. \n        Sir E. Grey is trying to arrange a conference between the Powers in order \n        to endeavour to avert this horrible disaster but the papers become more \n        and more grave and the situation is just hopeless. We think of nothing \n        else. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>July 29th, Wednesday</b></i><br/>\n        The blow has fallen. <b><i>Austria has declared war against Servia.</i></b> \n        Germany has not been able to accept Sir E Grey's proposals. Russia, Servia's \n        ally, is mobilizing in the South and the first shot has actually been \n        fired for Austria has captured two Servian ships on the Danube. Consternation \n        reigns in consequence and the situation becomes more and more frightful. \n        If Russia mobilizes in the North Germany will also, France must follow \n        and then we too will be bound to do so. In the face of this Greater Evil \n        the Irish question should be set aside but alas it cannot be and feeling \n        runs higher than ever. In consequence of the crisis the Stock Exchange \n        today shows a failure of 5 firms, one being George Craven, poor fellow \n        (a cousin of H's ) and he will be ruined. <br/>\n</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"401\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"415\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/july/Armageddon.jpg\" width=\"401\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><br/>\n<i><b>July 30th, Thursday</b></i><br/>\n        Yesterday in the Times Gazette Poggy read that the billet he had thought \n        he had a chance for has been given to Gen.

Everywhere all is upset, all leave has been cancelled, all officers \n        and men recalled from leave and consternation reigns. War has actually \n        begun and engagements have taken place, resulting in heavy losses on both \n        sides.

At \n        5.0 I drove down in a cab with him first to Tommy White to fit on a Kharki \n        coat for he had cast all his Kharki and then to the station when at 6.0 \n        he left. <span>(Herbert had to completely re-equip \n        himself, having sold off all his army equipment on his retirement.

The evening papers state that Germany is in a state \n        of Martial Law which means she is most certainly mobilzing and all seems \n        inevitable. One can't realize the horror of it all.

After a change we \n        dined Walter at a restaurant of his choosing, excellent dinner and music. \n        We also went on our arrival to his flat which is most comfortable and \n        full of treasures. <span>(Walter is Walter von Poellnitz, \n        Wynne's uncle)</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<b><i>June 10th</i></b><br/>\n        The weather has changed and it has been quite hot today.

At 10.0 \n        we started off intending to walk to Hechtsee but taking a wrong turn we \n        found ourselves on the road to the Thiersee so went there instead, it \n        was a long pull up and halfway down came the rain in torrents but we were \n        provided and on we plodded. At length we came to a plateau and there gathered \n        lovely little primulas, buck bean pansies and heaps of flowers I've never \n        see. Just below us lay the lake, lying like an emerald surrounded by hay \n        fields, white houses with red roofs and framed all round by huge blue \n        mountains. We returned another way and had done about 10 miles on reaching \n        town. I took an easy after lunch and at 4.30 we went and took coffee in \n        the Auracher Keller, a wierd dull sort of place on the river but it started \n        at once to rain and has done so ever since. <br/>\n</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"226\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"287\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/june/Rattenberg_street.jpg\" width=\"226\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><br/>\n<i><b>June 13th, Saturday</b></i><br/>\n        Rattenberg. We had intended doing the walk to the Kaisergebirge this morning \n        but though finer the mountains are all clouds so we decided to leave by \n        the 12.30 and after three quarters of an hour arrived at this 15th century \n        townlet. Finding no one at the station from the Ledererbra\u00fc, the \n        hotel we are staying at we attached an aged dienstmann to our luggage \n        and walked ahead. We entered the house by a low door way and found our \n        way along a vaulted dark tunnel where after a search the Hausmeister was \n        found - we then mounted two flights of dark staircases, groped our way \n        along pitchy passages till we came to our room. What was our surprize \n        on opening the door to find a large sunny room, two large windows and \n        everything perfectly spotless from the boarded floor to the white crochet \n        antimacassers which cover chairs and dressing table. Most elaborate are \n        the embroidered sheets and lace trimmed feather poufs and pillows and \n        actually in the centre of the room is electric light! For this delightful \n        room we pay 2 krone 40.! One could spend a cheap summer here! After lunch \n        which consisted of Kalbsnitzel we set forth to explore the town. It is \n        indeed a queer old place, the houses differing in size, height, shape \n        and colour are all built with the high \"feuermauer\" <span>(firewall)</span> \n        reaching far above the actual roof as a protection from fire and the doorways \n        are all low and arched giving on to tunnel-like passages of stone. The \n        street at one end runs through a tunnel under a house and the whole town \n        is but one street shaped like a P. We found an antiquit\u00e4ten shop \n        and on trying the door it proved to be locked. A tiny boy seeing us scuttered \n        past us like a rabbit down the tunnel shouting in a shrill voice \"Hans \n        yemand is da\" and down came Hans, a tall thin nice looking man with \n        whom we spent a half hour and bought some glass bottles, a brass candlestick \n        and several other curios. He talked incessantly in broad dialect but we \n        got on quite well and he had a kindly manner and a great love for all \n        his old things. Next door to him was a Museum containing some pieces of \n        furniture, iron work and domestic articles but the most curious part was \n        the house itself, roughly built into the solid rock with stone staircases \n        and iron barred windows and walls feet thick. We went into the kitchen, \n        a smoke begrimed hole with no outlet for the smoke except through a hole \n        in the roof and a square iron barred aperture which served for a window. \n        We next turned our steps across the river through hayfields where crickets \n        sang and hundreds of frogs croaked - up through the woods to Mariatal \n        to see the miraculous picture which till 1655 hung in a shrine in the \n        valley where twice it was removed by unseen hands to its present position \n        and the people recognizing the will of God built there a church over it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>June 14th</b></i><br/>\n        To our great disappointment when we awoke this morning we found that despite \n        the fact of its having rained all the night it was still pouring so we \n        waited patiently after having had our breakfast until 10.30 and in despair \n        went out, we first explored the ruined castle above the town, a most perilous \n        ascent, and went into the Tower where Wilhelm v Bienes <span>(?)</span>, \n        Chancellor of Tyrol<span> (in the 15th century) </span>was \n        beheaded, a great reformer. We returned here for lunch and then set off \n        for Brixlegg the next village to this, it is a quaint pretty little place \n        and we made our way to Castle Matzen where live Mr and Mrs Baillie <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Adolf_Baillie_Grohman\">Grohmann</a>. \n        The lady of the house an Englishwoman came and showed us all over it, \n        and it was most interesting. The tower is Roman and the place was bought \n        by his Mother who from a ruin restored it into its present beautiful condition. \n        It is full of treasures, old furniture, silver, pewter and glass and she \n        most kindly took us all over it. We also went into another old house and \n        found a very typical farmyard and courtyard and so home, weather still \n        horrible. <br/>\n</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"171\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"250\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/june/Tratzberg_small.jpg\" width=\"171\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><br/>\n<i><b>June 15th</b></i><br/>\n        Jenbach. The day began in a hopeless way, heavy misty clouds right down \n        the valley and rain again but thank goodness it cleared later on and we \n        left for Jenbach at 1.16 after paying our bill of 8 krone odd! Our destination \n        all along the valley of the Inn past the Zillertal towards which I looked \n        with longing eyes was only 3 stations off and as soon as we had settled \n        our luggage at the \"Tolerance\" hotel we started to walk up the \n        valley to the wonderful <a href=\"http://www.schloss-tratzberg.at/4.html?&amp;L=1\">Schloss Tratzburg</a>. I never came across a dirtier \n        road but our toil was rewarded for I never saw a finer place. It is in \n        the possession of Count Ensenberg and he keeps it up entirely in the old \n        style, even his own apartments look as if they had never been altered \n        - its all very well for show but I wouldn't care to live in the style \n        of our medieval ancestors: no carpets or curtains, no water or light arrangements, \n        and sanitary arrangements to match! but the rooms are grand and contain \n        the most perfect furniture one could wish for, the ceiling and wood panelled \n        walls are wonderful, the iron work and old locks on the doors all in keeping, \n        and they show you the rooms where Maximillian was lodged during his visits \n        there, on the wall is an inscription said to be by him. The castle in \n        its present state dates from the 16th century and there are said to be \n        365 windows. On our way home I gathered a bunch of every kind of flower, \n        including columbine, dianthus, broom, rape and scabious campanula and \n        heaps of others and then we went into the Church dated 1529, very ornate \n        and restored in the usual garish fashion. The village is a collection \n        of tiny narrow streets, one or two fine old houses but not so old or interesting \n        as Rattenberg. It is evening and I sit on the balcony of our bedroom with \n        the most perfect view before me. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/june/Tratzberg_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<i><b><span>This is the castle Wynne and Herbert walked \n        to: Schloss Tratzberg, in Jenbach.

No \n        sooner had we started than it began to rain, arriving at Seehof we took \n        steamer to Pertisau and the lake looked grey whilst the mountains and \n        sky were black! We lunched at the old F\u00fcrstenhaus built long ago \n        by the Counts of Tyrol, now owned by the Benedictine monks of Viecht. \n        After lunch it cleared a little and thinking we would like to see a little \n        of the country we decided to walk home as far as Eben where we hoped to \n        pick up the train on its return journey. Accordingly we set forth taking \n        the road all along the edge of the lake, the most muddy road I've ever \n        been on bar none. We had not gone far when the rain descended with renewed \n        violence, on on we tramped, arriving at length at Eben and having as we \n        thought half an hour to wait we went into the little Church where is the \n        tomb of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notburga\">St. Nothburga</a>, very touching is the evidence of the simple peasant \n        faith as displayed by the many votive offerings hung therein: wax models \n        of cows, horses, babies arms and more legs all denoting blessings of recovery \n        received by the faithful.

There was nothing for it but to plunge forth \n        into the rain again and walk the rest of the way home, very thankful we \n        were to reach the Hotel where hot coffee and dry clothes awaited us! This \n        is a busy little village, a great number of saw mills being its chief \n        industry, and there is a fine 16th century church and some old houses. \n        We left by the 7.00 reaching Innsbruck at 7.30.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"379\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"245\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/june/Innsbruck.jpg\" width=\"379\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><i><b>June 17th</b></i><br/>\n        Arriving last night we walked over to this large and most modern Hotel, \n        the Tyroler Hof.

I set off to have my hair washed and H to Cooks, \n        and then we commenced our tour of inspection. We found the Hofgasse, Landhaus \n        and Pfarrgasse all containing queer old houses, evidence of long bygone \n        times including in the Hofgasse the house which Sigmund built for his \n        court giant Haid, a figure of whom is erected outside - his legs look \n        weak! A little further on there dazzles one the quaint and far-famed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Roof\">\"Goldenes Dachl\"</a> which Kaiser Max raised as a memorial of his marriage with \n        Maria Bianca Sforza of Milan. We then went to the Hofkirche containing \n        the superb and quite unique tomb and double line of perfect bronze figures \n        intended by Max as his last resting place. His burial however took place \n        near Vienna. We went off after this to lunch at the Goldener Adler, for \n        many years Innsbruck's chief inn, where have slept Kaiser Max, Kotzebue, \n        Heine, Goethe and Andreas Hofer, and it was from the window of a room \n        there into which we went that the latter delivered an impassioned speech \n        to the people in anno '9.<span> (In the year 1809 \n        Archduke Charles appealed to the German people to resist Napoleon's ally, \n        Bavaria.

If it had only been fine the view from there would have been simply \n        splendid for we were fairly high and could see several valleys all round \n        us but of course they were full of mist. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b><i>June 19th</i></b><br/>\n        Bozen.

The presentation \n        to the town occurred in 1893, and of course when Wynne is writing he is \n        still on the throne, and his Empire still covered most of central Europe. \n        )</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>June 21st</b></i><br/>\n        Anxiously we looked at the weather this morning and found to our joy that \n        it was fair so at about 11 we took our seats in the Rittnerbahn which \n        crawls up the side of a mountain all along the Eisach valley as far as \n        Klobenstein...we lunched at the Hotel Post and then strolled along the \n        F\u00f6hnpromenade, a shady walk along the mountain side, and when we \n        had got some way we dipped down on to a green slope where amongst innumerable \n        flowers we lay in the sun and watched the clouds casting huge blue shadows \n        over the mountains across the valley opposite. Never shall I forget that \n        perfect view which stretched away for miles and miles before us, the insects \n        filled the air with their lazy thrumming drowsy sound, the lovely butterflies \n        flitted about from one flower to another and all the birds in the world \n        seemed to be singing. Alas the time came to move on and we then had a \n        most lovely walk back through woods and hay fields to the <a href=\"http://www.satoshi.de/hiking/oberbozen/index.html\">Ober Bozen</a> where \n        we had two large cafe melange each and caught the train on its return, \n        reaching home about 7.30...day of pure delight.<span> \n        (We are a mere week away from the assassination at Sarajevo - such is \n        the irony of history).<br/>\n</span><br/>\n<i><b>June 22nd</b></i><br/>\n        Regretfully we left Bozen today. It is a fascinating little place and \n        one might well spend a month there but though Time does not exist for \n        the Tyrol it does for us and have yet several places to visit. Accordingly \n        we left civilization at about midday and reaching Waidbruch in half an \n        hour consigned our luggage to be driven up. <span>(Wynne \n        and Herbert then walked up to S. Ubrich.)</span><br/>\n        All the inhabitants of this valley have for generations been wood carvers. \n        S.

Well, after about 2 hours climb we reached the H\u00fctte \n        and immediately sat down with glorious view in front of us and drank beer \n        and ate rolls. Never have I enjoyed anything more. We then continued to \n        climb till we reached the snow across a wide limestone plateau and here \n        we found Soldanella, both white and purple, and many tiny flowers I've \n        never seen before. <span>(Soldanella is an alpine \n        primrose, with a fluted trumpet. There are several varieties.) </span>Endless \n        are the flowers of these parts and something in the soil effects the colour \n        of many, the common parsley becomes pink, scabious takes on a pink tinge, \n        hawkweed is often orange and the varieties of vetch are endless. We also \n        found the loveliest mauve clematis growing like Travellers Joy and up \n        high, heaps and heaps of the large gentian. I've never seen so much colour. \n        All along the path the mountain stream rushed in a fussy way and we bathed \n        our faces in its icy waters and drank refreshing draughts. At last we \n        had to turn our steps homeward and on reaching S.C had coffee before stretching \n        our legs along the 3 miles that still lay between us and home. I have \n        enjoyed today, it has just been perfection.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>June 24th</b></i><br/>\n        If it was possible to do so I think I enjoyed today's exploration even \n        more than yesterday, but it is hard to say. We started off again on the \n        Mallpost and this time drove as far as Wolkenstein. <span>(This \n        time Wynne and Herbert walked up into the mountains from there and came \n        across a large open meadow)</span> The absolute stillness and almost prehistoric \n        feeling about it fascinated one and the ground was starred with big blue \n        gentian and pale lemon anemones.

On arrival we found the porter from the Gasthof zum Elefant, and \n        drove through this sunlit sleepy town to our old, old Inn. It was founded \n        in 1551 and so named because \"the first elephant to visit Europe \n        drew up on this spot and all the folk from far and near came to see it\", \n        as a set of verses painted on the wall together with the elephant, his \n        mahout and a gentleman, explains. The elephant looks very knowing, both \n        his eyes look at you though he is sideways on! The house is delightful, \n        large and roomy, old wooden ceilings and walls and endless pewter, glass \n        and pottery and in one room a magnificent old green stove. The cooking \n        is excellent, the beds most comfortable and very cheap. We arrived about \n        1.0 and soon after set out to explore. One thousand and ten years ago \n        Brixen was handed to Zacharias, Bishop of S\u00e4ben whereby it passed \n        from the possession of King Ludwig 111 to that of the diocese of S\u00e4ben. \n        <span>(Wynne explored the huge Minster, or \"Dom\", \n        commenting on the frescoes by Master Hugo.

The origin of this queer little place lay in Roman hands, who \n        called it Vipetenium, but in 1296 it had become a full-fledged municipality \n        but the story goes that it lacked a name and after many suggestions over \n        which none could agree they decided to call it after the first man to \n        pass their gates, and so laid in wait for him. To their dismay the first \n        to do so was a crippled beggar, however true to their decision they christened \n        the town Sterzing, borrowing from the local dialect the word St\u00f6rzer \n        which means vagabond. It is the most beautiful town I have ever seen. \n        Like Klausen, it consists of one street only larger and longer, every \n        house is a gem, all different sizes, shapes and colour with feuermauer \n        and many perfect old wrought-iron gilt signs, one and all being particularly \n        fine.<span> (Wynne then explored the old Rathaus and \n        other sites.

We \n        paid 1 krone at the Gasthof and got a key, then climbed up and up into \n        a very grand gorge where the water comes rushing and falls from a tremendous \n        height. We walked on some long way up the valley and had a queer meal \n        of salami, bread and butter at an isolated apology of a gasthof on our \n        way home. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>June 29th</b></i><br/>\n        We left Sterzing last night and came to this most comfortable hotel <span>(in \n        Steinach).

However \n        upon the door step of his house stood the worthy Pfarrer, his flock having \n        gathered around for service, it being St. Peter's day, so I went up and \n        said in pleading tones, \"K\u00f6nnen wir etwas zu essen haben bitte?\" \n        In genial tones he answered \"Ya, Gewiss\" and so we entered and \n        found that apparently they were accustomed to cater for passersby, and \n        we partook of the most delicious Kalbsnitzel and kartoffe, lovely butter, \n        bread and cheese and when finished I could have eaten it all again. It \n        was interesting to see all the men, women and children flocking in to \n        service, all in their Sunday clothes. The children are dressed like grown \n        up people, with their hair up and long frocks, the women all wear black \n        frocks now with gaily coloured aprons sometimes and the flat round hat \n        trimmed with gold underneath. One wealthy couple came to church followed \n        by two goats who were awfully disquieted at being locked out and attached \n        themselves to us!<br/>\n<span>(They walked home, getting wet again, and Wynne \n        noted 39 different flowers that she picked on the way.

Last night I got a \n        panic about Gran, she was sleeping so quietly that I had to come down \n        3 times before I finally settled off to sleep to hear if she was breathing, \n        and in the morning I heard she had slept like a child from 9 to 7. We \n        breakfasted at 8 at which meal I was not present owing to a fit of cramps \n        which kept me on my back for an hour (convenient day to choose) but by \n        9.30 I got down and was ready to cope with the uninterrupted procession \n        of letters, wires, presents and flowers that came pouring in. Lena and \n        I set to work and soon the drawing room looked like a flower shop, the \n        table then had to be arranged and I did it with the Gray's lovely flowers: \n        white, pink and mauve in tulips, narcissus and lilac. We lengthened the \n        Springfield table to its full length, covering it with the one huge cloth \n        belonging to it and for table centre put Aunt Aims pink worked one made \n        about 15 years ago! By the 1.0 train all our guests arrived from Town \n        whose names are to be found on the page before this and when they were \n        all assembled dear Gran was wheeled out. She knew and greeted all with \n        appropriate remarks and was much interested in her beautiful flowers and \n        presents and then we all went into lunch, a cold one on the table. I've \n        never seen anything so wonderful as Gran, she took notice of everyone, \n        made an excellent lunch and when we drank her health amidst a loud \"for \n        she's a jolly good fellow\" she supped up her champagne in return \n        with much appreciation and relish. <a href=\"../../diary_layout/wynneframeset.html?0,family,\" target=\"diary\">(Go \n        to the Family section for more information on the group here)</a></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"236\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"341\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/march/Birthdaymenu.jpg\" width=\"236\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>When lunch was over she retired to her room to rest whilst we occupied \n        ourselves till tea with quilps and cranks taking photos of us all in a \n        group and writing names in this book. By 4.15 tea was ready and in the \n        centre of the table was the huge cake adorned with silver wreaths, surrounded \n        by 100 candles - a really unique sight. Gran was delighted with it! Our \n        lunch party of 17 was added to by the Grays, Fairholmes, Dr Tanner and \n        Col. Fitzroy. Alas by the 6.0 train they all departed leaving us feeling \n        very blank but with the remembrance of a most successful and delightful \n        day behind us. Each and all have been much touched by the many thoughts \n        which have flown to Gran from all parts of the world, the telegrams from \n        the King and Lord Roberts bringing great pleasure and rejoicings, and \n        so ends this great day.<br/>\n<b><i><br/>\n        March 14th, Saturday</i></b><br/>\n        Still there arrive congratulations for Gran from all sorts of unexpected \n        quarters and from people one has heard nothing of for years. Gran doesn't \n        seem at all tired or over done to day and actually gave an interview to \n        a reporter of the Farnham Herald the result of which I stick in here <span>(you \n        can see it in the next page).</span> No less than 4 others came up yesterday \n        and this morning her picture and a description were already in the Daily \n        Mail. Lena, Thurie and Walter are staying on a few days, a very jolly family \n        party, but the poor Hamster is far from well and feels the cold considerably, \n        the weather is not behaving itself and we see but little of the sun at \n        present. We are busy making a list of all Gran's acknowledgements which \n        must be sent off, they have now reached 102!

Walter left us today to return to Mother, I am thankful \n        to have got him for 3 days, it just made the success of the party complete. \n        The usual Mothers' Meeting today, only about 7 more.

On Thursday night as I passed that wonderful \n        building on the way to Waterloo, its huge lighted up pile looked grimly \n        and mysteriously beside the river, the yard was full of cars and Big Ben's \n        face showed that the House was sitting. Outside in front of Westminster \n        Hall I saw the statue of that man of strength Oliver Cromwell and one \n        felt that once again had arisen the need of such a man to enter again \n        and sweep away the incompetent stuff that blinds and deliberately was \n        placing the Nation in such peril, but the days of the individual are over, \n        its all Party Politics and Socialism now-a-days, and Asquith with his \n        brood will just have to do what Redmond and Devlin etc tell them or retire \n        as private gentlemen minus their \u00a3400 a year. For weeks and months \n        and years even Ulster has seen this coming and are prepared to fight. \n        Yesterday troops were poured in by land and sea and when things came to \n        a head at the Curragh Brig. Gen. Gough and all his cavalry officers resigned \n        rather than go to Ulster. A pretty state of affairs and unprecedented \n        in modern history. Wild consternation on the part of the Government, \"brave\" \n        revengeful words from Seely which mean nothing at all as events will prove \n        and a general cave in will be the result. Meanwhile the W.O. Army Council \n        and the Cabinet are in a state of panic and Ulster in spite of intense \n        excitement is biding her time and Sir.

He is just as wizened a monkey as he was the day he acted \"best \n        man\" for H.

I was very much interested, \n        a most uncommon and exciting play but pathetic for the most part though \n        very true to life.

How long ago it seems since I saw \n        him. We left Town for Ipswich by the 11.40 and arrived about 2, going \n        to the Great White Horse. Soon after White T came in, he is stationed \n        here, and we went out into the town to agents and to hire a motor to view \n        3 houses. This we spent the afternoon in doing but none were any use and \n        country not particularly inviting. We got back about 6 and had dinner \n        after which we found our way to White T's quarters where we sat talking \n        till 10.30. When we returned to the hotel we found a seething mass of \n        people collected there, this is election week and Masterman has come down \n        to contest the seat with Ganzoni the Unionist and as this hotel is his \n        headquarters the people remained singing, cheering, booing and stamping \n        outside till nearly midnight. It was a wonderful sight. <span>(Masterman \n        must be Charles Masterman, serving in Asquith's government. In the February \n        election he lost his seat in Bethnal Green, London, and was sent to Ipswich \n        to contest what was presumably thought to be a safe seat.

Buckingham Palace was quite dark and only 3 of the many lights at the gates were lit.

Bede left today so in H's absence I am alone again a good deal of the day, but this I never mind and today I was able to motor down to the 22nd Brigade camp with H and on our way back looked in on Violet Wright who we met there by chance - her man is now A.S.C.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"348\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"200\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/october/SoldiersonHeath.jpg\" width=\"348\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><em><strong>October 2nd</strong></em><br/>\n        Today a great joy occurred. Mother, Mrs Skippy and the two children <span>(Ysobel and Eleanore)</span> motored over all the way from home and spent the day with us. They arrived about 12.30 and as the Division were up digging we took lunch out on to Beaulieu Heath where we found them all busy at trenches etc. Very soon H joined us and Capt. Rawlins and we gave the remainder of our lunch to poor passing Tommies who gratefully clawed in whatever they could get. We then returned to tea going to feed the horses before hand. I have tonight received a list of the men on H's staff, I am enlisting the interest of the other staff ladies and am going to see what can be done for their comfort whilst they are abroad as they belong to no unit and will get badly left if someone doesn't take it up. I insert here an extract from an order of the Kaiser, and the Times' Military Correspondent's remarks thereon. Comment is needless! <span><br/>\n        (This was the famous order which mentioned the \"contemptible little army\" ).</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>October 3rd</strong></em><br/>\n        We live on a veritable volcano these days thinking each day that the next is to be the last, but now it is not thought that they will move till Monday, so perhaps we shall see another sunday together in peace. My morning was spent in various errands for H and after lunch we motored together to Southampton, then to tea cam the Wrights and Mr Lindsell. Violet W looks so aged and worn, I fancy she has gone through some bad times. We had a great excitement in the Hotel tonight - I had gone out for a minute to get something at a shop near by, the \"Town\" was particularly full of soldiers being Sat, and when I came back after an absence of two minutes I found the Hotel quite dark, surrounded by a mass of men who also were pouring out of the house, and on enquiring ascertained there was a fire in the back premises! I, Mrs C and Mrs Leate went at once to the office where they despatched a picket but very soon it was put out and calm restored!</p>\n<p><em><strong>October 4th, Sunday</strong></em><br/>\n        It has indeed been a day of uncertainty and alarms. Poggy was able to come to Kirk at 11.0 and we stayed to sacrament. After lunch we walked to the Heavy camp, then to his own, and to tea, after which he went to Office and I sat down to write. Not long afterwards H came in and said \"We've got our order to start at 12.30 tonight\" - so we set about and packed. He later returned to Office and found they were trying to arrange to start at 8.30 tomorrow morning instead, and Capt Rawlins came in about 10.0 to say they had done so and went to bed about 11.30. He came again to say it was changed to 6.30 and at 1.30 he came once more to say it was 8.30!! All the night too troops were passing it seemed, the little town ringing with their cheers of \"Are we downhearted\" etc, so what with that and ones own anxiety we got but little sleep. </p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"286\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"208\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/october/SoldiersMarch.jpg\" width=\"286\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><span><em>Wynne's photo, taken from her hotel room, of some of the 7th Division marching through Lyndhurst. </em></span> </p>\n<p>You can read about the 7th Division by <a href=\"http://www.1914-1918.net/7div.htm\">clicking here</a>.

A diary is not the place in which to express one's feelings, but all the world knows what a woman feels when this sort of thing happens, the feeling of desolation which settles upon one and the prospect of the future which stretches ahead into a series of endless tomorrows.

He wrote at length and said they were having a smooth crossing, they then<span>(the Staff)</span> had had to change ships at the last moment as they found the 1st one did not sail till Tuesday, and Gen Capper was anxious to be over there early.

How weird to think our 7th Division landed there only about a week ago, the last of our troops to land there I fancy. I have heard since from a man in the know at the Admiralty that at the time they crossed 3 German submarines were in the Channel waiting for a chance! An awful thought. I went down to Aldershot to shop today, there one meets nowadays hundreds and thousands of K's Army drilling and working hard, some dressed in scarlet with Brodericks, others in dark blue with forage caps, it is a curious sight. Many scares of a raid upon the hangars at Farnboro are abroad, all lights are put out at night and a searchlight plays about constantly. </p>\n<p><em><strong>October 16th</strong></em><br/>\n        Thank goodness I am each day more busy than I can say. Today I've been doing the spring bedding out with Baker and then cycled over to the Leefes to tea. She had a letter from him on Wed but dated the 9th as my card was, carefully censored by himself apparently and no word therein of their whereabouts but on the envelope in large letters Hotel so and so (I forget), Ostend!! He says they knew of one submarine and 12 hours before they landed a grain ship was blown up by a mine close to where they went. Well, Thank God they landed in safety and we hear the Germans are at Ostend today. Alas another cruiser has been sunk, the Hawk, and 500 men are at present missing. Oh! it is so fearful for words. </p>\n<p><em><strong>October 17th</strong></em><br/>\n        To my great joy I received this morning a letter from my man and having contrived to send it some more expeditious way than usual I received it 2 days after it was written, just think of that these days. He was very well and had come into no actual action so far. It was a short note but most precious and I was so glad to get it. I took the children this afternoon to tea with Maggie in her most comfortable little quarters at North Camp. We went over them all and saw all her things, had a huge tea and then her man came in. I think they are both awfully lucky in one another and I only hope he doesn't get sent out as she feared he might about a fortnight ago. We had to walk back into Aldershot as we could get no bus and then took a taxi. Saturday night crowds swarmed. </p>\n<p><em><strong>October 18th</strong></em><br/>\n        My delight was tremendous this morning to find among my letters another from H, a real long one written on the 14th giving a most interesting description of their life and doings and he tells me they brought down 2 aeroplanes on the 13th and 14th. 2 out of 3 of the occupants of one were killed, the 3 wounded and 2 officers in the other captured. I do hope it was Capt Leefe's gun which did it, he says all was well with them but the poor infantry and horses suffering a good deal from the cobbles with which all main roads are paved.

Hundred of thousands \n        must be mourning throughout the world. I had the great joy of meeting \n        my dearest today at Euston. I went up from here by the 6.0, the Bacon's \n        lending me their car. When I arrived in Town having plenty of time I took \n        a bus to my Club. It was a perfect evening, the moon was high on one side \n        and the sky was clear and red on the other, the river reflecting the sunset \n        and the thousand lights, and the Houses with the Abbey looking clear cut \n        and black against the sky, quite lovely. I had dinner at my Club where \n        on the phone I had a long talk with Blanche Gray, poor lady she already \n        has him back again. He was run over by a gun team in action and broke \n        a rib and they rather fear it may be touching a lung. He is however very \n        cheerful and comfortable, settled in a nursing home in Town. Well at about \n        9.30 I walked up Bond Street and got a bus to Euston. What a different \n        London to the old gay times which at this hour or rather from 7 onwards \n        is one rush for the theatres. Hardly a taxi did I see and no single theatre \n        goer. <i><span>(see bottom for cutting about blackouts) \n        </span></i>Arriving at Euston I prepared for a long wait, the train was \n        not due till 10.45 and half an hour after that one came in, the Scotch \n        Express from Edinburgh, to my consternation H was not in it but I was \n        told the second portion was to follow which it did at 12.15 and there \n        he came. We motored home all the way arriving at a quarter to two. A perfect \n        clear moonlight night and we hardly met a soul the whole way down. What \n        a joy to see him again. <br/>\n</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"192\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"424\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/september/SedanCutting.jpg\" width=\"192\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><br/>\n<i><b>Sept. 2nd<br/>\n        Sedan Day, 2nd Sept. 1870</b></i><br/>\n        A busy day spent in getting H's kit together.

The Bacons lent us their car and he left by \n        the 11.20 from Farnham. There is just a vague chance we may meet again, \n        as the date of his sailing is not certain and I might go down to Southampton. \n        Just at present life has no particular aim and the future seems to stretch \n        out into a series of endless tomorrows. God help us all. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>Sept 4th</b></i><br/>\n        Yesterday the first casualty list came out, a long one but alas not the \n        least complete of course and so it doesn't relieve our anxieties.

Capts Birley and Bailey are wounded, and so many \n        other gunners, one simply dreads the papers these days. I got a letter \n        from my dearest today saying that as the time of sailing would not be \n        yet he saw no reason why I shouldn't go down to Southampton and so joy \n        of joy I go tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>Sept 5th</b></i><br/>\n        I left home by the 11.20 and reached S at about 1.20., the train being \n        very late.

We motored \n        to the Hotel in a govt. motor he had and there found dear Ba Cameron that \n        was, and her man Capt Salt. She has been here a month as he was embarkation \n        officer and is now G.S.O. to Gen Capper, the general commanding 7th Division. \n        We motored out to Lyndhurst after tea to find it swarming with soldiers. \n        We went to hunt for rooms and after a great search found some in the Stag \n        Hotel. It will be ripping out there in the New Forest, all sorts of people \n        are here, White T turned up today, he is to command the Horse Gunners \n        under H, how curious that seems. Charles Bridge is also here. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>September 6th, Sunday</b></i><br/>\n        I have spent a day of real rest doing literally nothing but bask in the \n        sun from morning till night. At 6.30 we went to Church, St Mary's, and \n        there found that Mr Lovatt was preaching, ex Rector of Farnham. I had \n        forgotten he had been appointed here. It has been a lovely day, so still \n        and warm and as this Hotel has a very nice garden one can laze as much \n        as one likes. I was sleeping peacefully under a tree when I heard a voice \n        saying \"Here she is\" and on looking up saw H bringing White \n        T along, so nice to see him again. We all had tea together and talked \n        over many things. Alas today brings news of the sinking of HMS Pathfinder \n        from a mine 20 miles from our coast, and as a result very heavy loss of \n        life.

It is too beastly for \n        words and makes one's blood boil with disgust and indignation. Villages \n        absolutely ransacked and every single article in the houses smashed wantonly, \n        down to chairs and school desks and harmless cottage pictures and ornaments. \n        What a horrible thing war is! Thank you ever so much for your letter. \n        We have had no letters for about 12 days! I believe several lots of mails \n        have gone astray. It's funny writing this peacefully in absolute safety \n        in a roadside field with guns dealing out death a couple of hundred yards \n        away! I am very fit and well. Your paper medicines have been a great boon. \n        I long to be home to the garden and flowers and little Babe and all of \n        you. This is a lovely country and it is dreadful to see so many people \n        after years of unremitting and anxious toil now left homeless, without \n        a single cow, horse or sheep and all their possessions in the house wantonly \n        destroyed and in a few cases the houses burnt wantonly. A poor old village \n        woman was shot by Germans yesterday because she had given a drink of water \n        to a Tommy. We are moving on now so I must stop.

Left \n        to myself I hired a bicycle and made a long explore. I rode to Lymington \n        then round by Beaulieu home.

I \n        came home over the high ground between B and this, a lonely way and an \n        atrocious road, and as I dipped down the numerous camps beneath me were \n        really a wonderfully interesting sight, horses feeding, men cooking and \n        washing, all so busy after a long day out. <span>(Wynne \n        thought nothing of doing these long bicycle rides - this one must have \n        been over 20 miles - see map at the bottom of this page).</span><br/>\n</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"391\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"194\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/september/LyndhurstCamp_horseline.jpg\" width=\"391\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p> <i><b>Sept 22nd, \n        Tuesday</b></i><br/>\n        I should think surely the height of vandalism has been reached by German \n        \"culture\" in the destruction of Reims Cathedral <span>(see \n        next window)</span>. It is almost unbelievable to think that this ancient \n        monument, the crowning place of Kings, is now a heap of ruins. The tapestries \n        luckily had been removed but there is nothing else left alas, and the \n        citizens are enduring much misery from terror and famine and are hiding \n        in the cellars. How little do we realize here in England what war really \n        means. God grant we may never have cause to. I went into the forest today, \n        there all was intense silence and stillness. A heron flew lazily over \n        and small herds of forest ponies grazing, the only sounds being a busy \n        woodpecker and two owls calling one to another. One could not imagine \n        war could be anywhere. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>September 23rd, Wednesday</b></i><br/>\n        Today the horrible news has come that 3 cruisers have been torpedoed in \n        the North Sea. The Aboukir, Hogue and Cressy, and it is estimated that \n        1200 lives have been lost at one fell swoop. Why our battle losses are \n        nothing in comparison, heavy though they are. The Aboukir was the first \n        to go and as the others came up to save lives they suddenly went down \n        also. I think it is a wonder that all our seaman aren't maniacs living \n        as they always must at such high tension. Well this has been a strenuous \n        day as the whole Division has been out on a Field Day, starting at 6.0, \n        getting in at about 3.0. As H had to breakfast at 5.30 I awoke every hour \n        through the night, struck a match, found it too early, and then finally \n        slept over the time and woke with a start to hear H say its 10 to 5. I \n        was so vexed but he got down at 5.30 nonetheless, and then I sat decked \n        out in a blanket and dressing gown on the window ledge and watched them \n        going by, such a procession, it took hours to pass. I had an early breakfast \n        and after I had finished I was called up on the phone by Brenda of all \n        people who is at Southampton to meet Oswald from Malta so I got her to \n        come out here and we went out on the Heath in a car, took lunch and saw \n        them all come in, it was a sight, miles of them. <br/>\n        I got this treasure <a href=\"http://www.wynnesdiary.com/1914_pages/september/viewer_7.html\">letter</a> yesterday from Skippy, how one does value such \n        a thing, what horrors he tells of poor people and poor land, but he is \n        well thank God, at any rate when he wrote it on the 8th. So many have \n        come to grief that one is always anxious. Philip Lyster is a prisoner. <br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>Sept 24th</b></i><br/>\n        I spent a most lovely morning in the Forest, hired a bicycle and rode \n        away into the Greenwood, taking my \"elevens\" and my writing \n        and sat there from 10 until 1, a typical Sept. day and utter stillness. \n        I sat in a huge grove of old beech trees and one could not imagine that \n        such a thing as war existed, so remote and quiet it was that once a large \n        old fox padded by, too intent upon his business to see me. We were much \n        horrified to realize today that Ni's boy young Archie was on the Cressy, \n        but relieved this evening to find him among the saved. The battle for \n        the Aisne still rages, this is the 14th day and what a fearful time they \n        must be having, so many officers have been killed and I hear General Haking \n        and Gen. Snow are both wounded. </p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"424\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"503\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/september/Map.jpg\" width=\"424\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_9": {"order": 9, "title": "Viewer 9", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1914/september/Rheims_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><b><span>The Germans had already \n        shocked Europe by the destruction they caused in Belgium, which may partly \n        have been responsible for the rapid development of the brutality stories. \n        While some of these were undoubtedly Allied propaganda the Germans did \n        themselves no service by demolishing Rheims cathedral - it offered another \n        public relations coup to the other side....as the Morning Post leader \n        put it:</span></b> <i><span>\"There can be no \n        adequate expression of anger at the destruction of Rheims Cathedral: the \n        tongue of man is unequal to it...but neither in her professions nor her \n        actions has Germany prepared for the future.

I am up early every morning and as I have dear Maggie here to help me with the children I have plenty of time for odd jobs. Mother and I went to tea with Mrs Perceval.

The whole thing was desolate and her poor man and Baby - oh, how sad it all is! </p>\n<p><em><strong>April 23rd</strong></em><br/>\n        Today I bicycled over to Whitmead to see the Hurdwoods, it was long since I was there. I found them all rather sad, they miss the Dr so who died on the day dear Gran was buried, 15th Feb. They are still intending to live on there as Government have taken on the san and Geoff with a locum runs it. Their little place looked as sweet as ever. I dined this evening with the Skippys, and there met a varied company, one a man who began life as one of Skippy's Lance Corporals and is now a Capt (New) and another man and his wife who effected their escape from Brussels in the the most thrilling manner of course and to whose adventures I listened with much interest. He is now doing Sapper work in Aldershot. It seemed quite strange to be at even a little dinner party again. I hardly knew how to behave! </p>\n<p><em><strong>April 24th</strong></em><br/>\n        The children went down at 3.30 to birds nest at the Fitzs' and I followed to tea. Their garden is looking lovely, it is certainly a sweet place but I wish I had that garden to play with. </p>\n<p><em><strong>April 25th</strong></em><br/>\n        Yesterday our dear Ell started for Europe where his destination or what his regiment is we don't know. His cable only said Europe and for 3 mails we haven't been able to write. I spent today in bed and thoroughly enjoyed it, not feeling very up to the mark. </p>\n<p><em><strong>April 26th, Monday</strong></em><br/>\n        The weather has turned cold and grey and such icy winds. I to my MM this afternoon, the last but one. Oh! how I long for the end, its seemed an awfully long term this time but everything seems long these days and everything stale and unprofitable and I'm sick of it all. </p>\n<p><em><strong>April 27th</strong></em><br/>\n        Win and I walked into Farnham to do some final shopping for her. The weather was extraordinarily hot, indeed coming up the hill loaded with parcels it felt like summer.

We got there by 7.10 and what a glory of a morning it was, brilliant sun and heat mist in the valley which disclosed as it lifted, hundreds of tents all round. He picked flowers whilst I guarded the machines and smoked a peaceful cigarette. Many cuckoos quarrelled around us and all the larks filled the sky with their joyous songs, how could one realize that just over the water such strife and slaughter were being enacted. Being a very hot day I spent the afternoon in the hammock and slept! We teaed in the garden and then I worked, watered till 7.30. After my modest supper Skippy came over and we walked up on to the Common there to see a wonderful scene. We went to the edge of Hungry Hill and below us on one side as far as the eye could see lay Aldershot and Farnborough, a blaze of innumerable lights. In the distance the air factory brilliantly lit up and with a huge search light alongside working all over the sky for ever scanning the distances with its diligent eye. On the other side another though smaller cluster of lights showed where Farnham lay, above which on the heights of Hindhead two huge red heath fires blazed away and above all there rose the moon, a misshapen red fire ball. In the far distance came faintly the sounds of bugles sounding Last Post, mens' voices, horses neighing and an occasional scream of a train. An interesting scene and most fascinating but hardly could one realize the presence in the near distance of thousands of men. </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}}, "errors": [], "description": "\n\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n<p><span>Wynne has been keeping her diaries since 1895. \n  \"A heart-ache about Spring this year...\" </span></p>\n\n\n"}, "august": {"viewers": {"viewer_1": {"order": 1, "title": "Viewer 1", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/august/Aug_Wallpaper_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<p><strong><em>Wynne's opening two pages for August contain a piece of wallpaper from a room in a ruined chateau that her husband had sent her - probably from a room he had been billeted in - and on the facing page a card of a ruined hotel, but not sadly the one related to the wallpaper.

I'm getting quite a practical hand at that particular form of amusement. He left early Wed morning. That day I explored St Pauls, in a way it reminded me of St Peters but is not nearly so beautiful in my poor opinion. I went up the many steps into the lovely old Library with its beautiful books, the shelves whereon they rest all carved by Grinling Gibbons, then to the Whispering Gallery where by some curious reason you can hear the guide's whispering voice booming at you right across the dome and finally visited the Crypt wherein lie so many of our famous soldiers and sailors and where I had a flirtation with an old \"dry as dust\" and the crypt cat which I found curled up on one of the wreaths! I just saw Win for a short time today but she was not fit for visitors so I didn't stay. I've seen two theatres, \"The Ware Case' and \"The Case of Lady Camber\", the former splendid, the latter rotten. I've also been shopping like mad and we've had vile weather, such rain. I go to Win to tea this afternoon and to the Abbey this morning. </p>\n<p><em><strong>December 13th, Monday</strong></em><br/>\n      My stay up here is drawing to a close, I'm awfully sorry I've really enjoyed the rest and its cleared away a cold I had had for weeks. At 11.30 Lady F came in and smoked a friendly cigarette with me. I wish I could see more of her but our lives lie apart. I then paced the shops, Regent Street mostly, trying to find various things which I failed in finding, had a vile lunch at Fullers for which they kept me waiting and then in due course repaired to Win with whom I stayed till 6. Mrs Lees was also there. I felt quite sad to think I should not see the child again but I can't stay away from home any longer, leaving Mother to look after my house and children and do my chores at the Hut.</p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/december/UrduCard_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<span><em><strong>The Field Postcards were a regular feature of the war - there are many in the diaries.

I leave Win wonderfully well thank goodness. At Waterloo this morning the place was crowded with our men coming home on pass, most had come straight form the trenches and were thick mud from head to foot, and such costumes! Some had fur linings outside their coats and looked like eskimos, their hats were all shapes, their rifles, haversacks and all accoutrements were nothing but dried mud. I should think they were not the only occupants of their clothes. </p>\n<p><em><strong>December 15th</strong></em><br/>\n        I found all well at home yesterday except Mother's cold which will not leave her. I really think a change is the only thing and that she'll get when she goes to Town on Friday. She and I went to the Hut tonight and were busier than ever. I am convinced that as time goes on the place becomes more and more full, my dept. - cakes - is really more than one person can manage as one has to keep one's stall supplied with cakes as well as serve. We had a concert given tonight by the Presbiterian <span>(sic)</span> Choir, a party consisting of about 20, and the style of song was \"I stood on the Bridge at Midnight\" and various glees where each person vied with the other in trying to sing his part louder than her. It was most painful but the men thought it was lovely. Mother and I exchanged mournful and despairing glances. </p>\n<p><strong>December 16th, Thursday</strong><br/>\n        I spent the morning in doing up Mother's parcels for her. We got about 13 done up and despatched. As each day passes I tick one off in my mind against my dear man's coming for if all goes well he comes on Monday as ever is for Xmas and I go up to meet him staying the night and meet Pink the next day. I can't bear to think of it hardly. I wrote mail letters hard all the afternoon and when Mother had gone to bed continued to do so till 12.0 but of course they'll be too late for Xmas. Everything like that has had to have the go-by this year, I've been too full of other matters but all that is over now. </p>\n<p><em><strong>December 17th</strong></em><br/>\n        I can hardly write of the horrible calamity which has befallen me today - I had a letter from my dear tonight which said that owing to rumours of increased activity on his line that leave would in all probability be stopped and so he is not coming home after all. I can't bear the thought, it had come so near and I was counting on it so immensely and now its all done for. Its hard to be philosophical under the circumstances. Mother went to Town this morning. I had my Hut as usual and was thankful as it helped to take my thoughts off this most bitter disappointment. I feel as if all the brightness had been dashed out of my life tonight but I shall be better tomorrow. </p>\n<p><em><strong>December 18th</strong></em><br/>\n      I thought I would be very clever and try to go to Aldershot by the new bus which starts from Hale now, and went up the road to meet it at Charmans only to find that it was full. By luck I picked up a taxi there so wasn't very late. I was the only lady at the Hut today, the others all being ill I suppose, but the men helped and as we had no rush it didn't matter. I went then into the vile Town to do some shopping and not being able to get a bus home had to take taxi again. No letter today from Poggy owing to the fact that I had two yesterday. I still feel desolee, there is little or no balm in Gilead for me at present. </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_7": {"order": 7, "title": "Viewer 7", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/december/BombSanta_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<em><strong>A Christmas Card from the 3rd Division - on the back in pencil is written: \"We were issued with one of these\". <br/>\n          The Kind of Santa Claus we may expect on Christmas Eve. \n          <br/>\n</strong></em></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"300\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"450\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/december/BombSanta_lge.jpg\" width=\"300\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_8": {"order": 8, "title": "Viewer 8", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n<p><em>December 19th - 23rd</em></p>\n<p>Absent husband and sad news does not make for a specially festive time.

Bessie who I forgot to mention was married last Monday, returned home last night, she is now Mrs Kenny and her man has gone back again and as Maggie comes tomorrow I shall two Mrs in the house.

I know that they are continuing to fight there and every day the papers contain accounts of artillery duels on the Ypres line so that I know he must be engaged, its all so dreadful and I am horribly anxious but one has only to practice patience and bravery.

I went down in the morning with Nootle to church decorate, this is a task she always helps me in. To the Hut this evening and when I returned we filled the stockings, dear me how different from other years when one really could be gay but we laughed a good deal this evening because Win had hung up her pyjamas and so after filling her stocking and putting it in first we filled the rest with various useful things, coconuts, the poker, vegetables, lampshade and basket etc, the appearance of the legs when completed was simply screwed. </p>\n<p><strong><em>December 25th</em></strong><br/>\n        I can make no special ornamentation of my Xmas page this day, I'm simply not in the humour.

On Monday last poor old Col Fitzroy died, he had been ill about 6 weeks and at last his heart failed. He will be much missed and I am so sorry for her. I went today to his funeral, many people were present and the R.A.Band attended and played most beautifully.

I don't care how quickly it does it. Seldom has there been a whole year of such untold misery to the World at large and at any rate one feels that one year of our anxiety and sorrow has passed away. It has all been terrible. I have not written or even touched on half or quarter of the large happenings it has contained partly because diary writing in these days is apt to become rather crowded out by the immense amount of other jobs one has to do and partly because one hasn't the heart to sit and deliberately make note of all the miserable things that are taking place from day to day. The year has gone out wildly raging: storms and torrents of rain - in the same manner as it began. I was at the Hut tonight and as we had a very heavy night with many hundreds in I feel too fagged to stay up and see the New Year in. Really these days one takes little thought for these extras, and so to bed.

He said some of his men were grubbing about for fragments of German shells and found ordinary common marbles instead of lead bullets in their shrapnel, and added \"either they must be uncommonly hard up for lead or else some contractor is making money fast\". I never heard anything so odd. In today's letter he tells a wonderful story. An Irish guardsman brought in a machine gun single-handed at La Basee. he found 10 Germans in a pit with this gun, shot 8 and seizing the remaining 2 by the scruff of their necks he banged their heads together and brought them and their gun into our lines. He is to be recommended for the VC.

And so the long and wonderful life is at an end and the last of the Wolflee lot has gone to Rest. Mother and Aim stayed the night and were a great help in the numberless things there are to do at these times, and I was very glad to have them.

CB, DSO is a very neat collection and I am much honoured with reflected glory. <br/>\n        We find ourselves most comfortable here in a large and clean hotel, the food is good, the rooms large and clean, the people very attentive and they do you for 3 guineas a week inclusive.

It seems to me that a deal of mildew must grow around the brain of such people yet everyone must carve his salvation out for himself in his own way. There are very few people in the hotel as its quite out of season, and those that are are deeply pogbaggish but after all we didn't come here to look at their pansy faces.

The country round here is flat, bare and ugly but the coast is splendid, a cruel coast with many deep bays and caves and not much foreshore anywhere. I have explored a good deal but Stella didn't feel up to walking so I had to go alone, which on the shore is rather bogeyish sometimes. There is a small town with some quite nice shops but I wish the country wasn't so windswept and treeless.

I heard this morning from Bill who has been offered a commission, what in I don't know, but he mentions the 9th Division which is the Scotch one here. He sent me the most interesting memento straight from the Trench, a jam label off one of their pots, all duly signed. I was pleased.

Charlie is home ill with very bad flu and the after-effects of concussion caused by a shell bursting just behind his dug out.

We went instead into St Paul's where an Intercession Service was going on and listened awhile to the lovely music.

Letters from my man, nothing much doing and all this inactivity though blessed for our nerves makes the time seem to drag still more and the future stretches out in an endless series of tomorrows. Horrible news of a fearful earthquake from central Italy comes today.

I was reading over one of my old Diaries last night, how curiously different from the journals I produce year by year now-a-days, but how much wiser it is, for this particular one I was reading was full of sentiments and feelings and though all my old journals are kept locked there must surely come a day when other eyes but mine will read them and so I shall come in for a good deal of careless jibes and jeers! This one was about my first meeting with Herbert and it is odd reading in the face of all that happened afterwards. Blessed day that brought us together. </p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"276\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"428\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/january/PC_Kaisers.jpg\" width=\"276\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><em><strong>January 18th, Monday</strong></em><br/>\n        The day of the Winter Tea Party for my women has come and gone and I always feel a relief when this comes to pass.

I returned to find my dear old Gran battling with the maids and wanting as she always does every night now to go off home.  I am distracted, I really don't know what to do with her, in body she is wonderfully well but her mind at times is hopelessly gone and tonight she was furious and vowed she would never come again etc.etc.  So old a being is a great problem.

We went up by the 10.2 and arrived half an hour late, conveyed his box to P and then rushed over to Mother to lunch, leaving her as we thought in plenty of time we found on reaching the station that her clock was ten minutes slow and if his train had not been late in starting we should have missed it. I then flew to the stores in the most awful weather, shopped and flew on to Waterloo where I had arranged to meet Brenda. I waited and waited and at 3.5 I found the 2.10 had not left the station and no B was to be seen so I went and had tea, then strolled out and sat in the train.

Gore Browne, responding to Wynne's enclosing the photos you see above. 5.10.</p>\n<p>Dear Mrs Jackson<br/>\n              I am very much ashamed of myself for not having written before to thank you for the wedding groups.  I was awfully glad to have them, the intellectual expression of the contracting parties is something to be glad of in these superficial days. One question.  Is it to be hoped that somewhere about next March ? the union may be blessed etc?  If so I should like to be allowed to present a christening mug.  Of course there's always the chance that a War baby may have already appeared - one is so suspicious of these hastily carried out marriages. <br/>\n              I don't know what to tell you in the way of news, as I expect you hear it all.  The General is very well, and wonderfully cheerful and equable in spite of the Arctic beastliness of the vulgar little booth we inhabit.  I expect he's told you all about it - how the beautiful blue sky and the lush green grass show through the walls, and the sound of the spitting of the ancient Flemish farmer in the next room mingles with the cooking of our (ex Mauretania) chef. However we're off tomorrow, thank goodness. <br/>\n              You will have heard all the tales, repeatable and unrepeatable, I expect also.  One rather nice incident occurred the other day when a soldier wrote to a cousin of mine asking her to send him some drawers, \"for my trousers are so harsh they have my skin scoured off me\"!  I thought it was rather prettily put. <br/>\n              My home has become a hospital, at least Brooklands has, and my people now inhabit the servants' hall.  I rather envy the patients in it, but very likely they'd prefer a nice cheery spot like the Herbert Hospital with its outlook on the cemetery, one never knows. <br/>\n              I am always meaning to write to your son to thank him also for a photograph in which I look only a little less inane than the bride and bridegroom, but that is by the way, I expect I do too. <br/>\n              The apology for a fire in Dobb's 50 Franc stove has ceased apologising for the last hour and icicles are beginning to form on the Louis Seize chairs (spoils of Ypres which adorn our hut like rubies round a charwoman's neck) so it is fully time I got into my blankets, and the General into his.  He is sadly reading the Daily Mail of the day before yesterday (price 2d in this country) at the moment.  Once more thank you for the photographs.  Yours sincerely, S Gore Browne. <br/>\n</p>\n<p>A second letter was sent, written 18.10.1915.</p>\n<p>Dear Mrs Jackson,<br/>\n              Thank you very much for your letter.  All I can say is that if they've been in bed for 5 months on end, and still there's no change then the gentleman must be what Le Petit Bob said the visitor was of whom his mother had such a poor opinion, in Gyp's (?) book of that name!<br/>\n              We are still idling and living in comparative comfort.  I said to the old woman who cooks for us, the other day, that the general was pleased with his food.  She beamed all over, and asked if you were a good cook.  I plunged in, and was in the middle of explaining that you were famed throughout England for your feats in the kitchen which only just fell short of her own, when her husband interposed with \"Perhaps, since he is a General, he keeps a cook as well as a wife\"!<br/>\n              We are anxiously awaiting our next orders.  To be prepared for everything I have sent for a Greek Testament, the only book in the language I now possess, but I think it is hardly likely to be required.  Opinions still vary and everywhere from the Keil Canal to the Caucasus is still suggested.<br/>\n              Thank you very much for the kind things you say at the end of your letter.  As far as I am concerned anyhow they are only too little deserved.  I wish they weren't - for it would be quite impossible to have anyone nicer or easier to work for.  I'm not saying that to please you.  I wish you could hear what all sorts and conditions of people say in the Division, on the same subject.  Perhaps you can realise the difference it makes when everybody both trusts and is fond (the two don't always go together) the man who is responsible for them, and how grateful one is. <br/>\n              Please, whatever you do, do not say that I said this - but I thought you would like to hear it perhaps first hand. <br/>\n            Yours very sincerely, S Gore Browne. </p></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_2": {"order": 2, "title": "Viewer 2", "excerpt": "\n\n\n<p><em>\n\n              July 1st - 8th </em></p>\n<p><span>Wynne's depression with the war deepens when she learns her husband it to go back to France.

I am feeling most horribly ill \"what can the matter be\", its bad luck when just today I'd like to be fit. </p>\n<p><strong><em>July 10th</em></strong><br/>\n        A true calamity has befallen this morning. I felt less of a beast but upon looking at myself in the glass behold I was covered with rash! I went down with H and said goodbye to him at the station and tried to find Tanner <span>(her doctor)</span> but he was out however at 4.0 he came and pronounced me to have German Measles. My thoughts fly to Poggy - supposing he gets it out there. I am haunted by the thought. </p>\n<p><strong><em>July 11th</em></strong><br/>\n        My man writes that he doesn't leave Winchester until Monday and is to cross Tuesday night and as all his baggage and office has gone he will spend Mon. night with the Franks at Crowborough. How horrible it is to contemplate that if it were not for my vile measles he could have come here. I do not feel cheerful today. </p>\n<p><strong><em>July 12th</em></strong><br/>\n        What is there to write about when you are in bed with measles, when your man is going to the Front and when you can't see him - the less said the better I think. </p>\n<p><strong><em>July 13th, Tuesday</em></strong><br/>\n        Today a fateful wire arrived from Ell: \"Ordered Front\" it read. On Sat. I had one \"Leave Postponed\". He had hoped to get over last week and so now we know why he can't get here. Oh! God protect them both. </p>\n<p><strong><em>July 14th</em></strong><br/>\n        This morning I got 2 letters from Crowborough and his farewell wire sent from Folkstone so that is the end and by now he must be in France and the old ache has begun again, accentuated by the added presence of dear Ell there, and its all like a hideous nightmare. This enforced idleness on my part does not help matters but I am going to get up tomorrow and shall garden all day long. The evening is grey and so are my thoughts. <br/>\n        The papers are all agog on account of the Welsh Miner Strike which in defiance of their leaders advice the men declare they will bring off tomorrow. Accordingly the Government have served them the first course of the Munitions Act and we will see what happens tomorrow. I wish the earth would swallow the lot up. </p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"200\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"197\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/july/FieldPC_small.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong><em>July 15th Thursday</em></strong><br/>\n        Today by the 2nd post I got a Field PC from my dear so I know that his crossing is safely over and he has reached Boulogne <span>(and you can see the PC in the preceding window).</span> Nothing from Ell as yet.

The men like so many blatant fools are totally unaware of these deep waters. I came down here today and am isolated in my little room and the garden where I feebly tried to do some work but Oh! how groggy I am.

This cutting about my beloved Venice delights me, how I would love to see it under these conditions, quite like its old days. How awful if anything happens to St Marks and the Doge's Palace.

He had a splendid crossing and says it was rather a wonderful show as all the way they were escorted by torpedo and picket boats. He said that they were to be there for 4 or 5 days and then move nearer the firing line. He sent me this delightful picture of our German \"friends\" dressed up in their respirators but wished me to paste paper over the reverse! This I certainly shall not do and I only wish the whole of it were there! He also sent me this little flag: they were having France's Day and this had been given to him. <span><em>(The flag is at the top of this page, the mask cartoon in the next window)</em></span>. No more cases of measles yet but its bound to come. I keep reminding myself, Oh! if Poggy only escapes it would be awful if he were to get it. I've been gardening a lot today but such a gale blowing and lots more rain, too vile for words. </p>\n<p><em><strong>July 18th</strong></em><br/>\n        What is the matter with the weather in this old country, it pours and rains, blows a gale and as for the sun we never see him except when he looks dissipated and bleary eyed. Another letter from my old darling, he tells me he has had a narrow shave of being under Sir H.R's command again, ye gods! what a thought. <span>(A reference to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Rawlinson,_1st_Baron_Rawlinson\">Sir Henry Rawlinson</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/Henry_Rawlinson,_1st_Baron_Rawlinson\"></a>, a general \"promoted by Haig each time he lost a battle\" as Denis Winter notes in \"Haig's Command\").</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>July 19th, Monday</strong></em><br/>\n        Mother came today and I hope she will stay some time with me.

Dear old man he has reached Rouen and is there awaiting orders and thinks he'll either be sent to the 15th or 4th Cavalry. I do wonder if he'll meet H, the latter and his Division were to move to their line yesterday and I gather it is somewhere between Ypres and Estaires. </p>\n<p><em><strong>July 20th</strong></em><br/>\n        I spent my morning picking raspberries for bottling and jam and the afternoon making up 5 parcels for my different men, 2 of whom are prisoners. These latter are a fearful business, each parcel must be done up in 2 separate wrappers and contain another string label and paper and 3 notices have to be written out for each and the address is written 3 times on each, the only saving grace being that they go post free.

LG has been down talking to the men and new concessions have been put to them by the Government which they have graciously accepted. It is awful to see how the serving of the Munitions Act was not the slightest bit of use, they simply ignored it and it is a horrible thought to realize that any body of men can defy a Govt. measure, surely the beginning of the end to law and order.

Perhaps it is on account of the weather which is disgusting, every day we get torrents and buckets of rain and high gales just like October. I tried to do a little gardening but it was no joy, and Poggy writes that he has suspicions of measles, oh! my dear and the Russians are now retreating on Warsaw and its all horrible. I hear today that Gen. Baldock has been badly wounded, I am so sorry and that Gen. Percival is to get his Division. I didn't even know he was out there. </p>\n<p><em><strong>July 24th</strong></em><br/>\n        This letter about Gallipoli is so interesting, he is a splendid writer and I wonder has he ever written a book.

The following story is sweet - a Corporal of his just before leaving Winchester found a lot of new harness that had been left behind so the thrifty man put it into a sack and took it along. In due course a breeching broke and he at once said he had some in his sack but when it was produced and emptied it was found to contain nothing but manure! Either he had picked up the wrong sack in the dark or someone had stolen it and replaced it by this treasure! Anyhow he'll never hear the last of it I fancy. </p>\n<p><em><strong>July 26th</strong></em><br/>\n        I bicycled in this evening to the Hut as usual taking with me a huge armful of roses to make our counter smart for it is concert night, and such a concert, just as the tommy loves: popular, patriotic and sentimental.

He writes an amusing story of the inhabitants of Limbourg: their anniversary of the \"Battle of the Spurs\" fought in 1302 between Flemish and French was at hand and they asked leave of the Governor to celebrate it by sports. One item was a bicycle race in which they were allowed to indulge on condition they each carried a German flag so at 2.30 fifty young men set forth and at 4.0 a German band began to play in the Square where the people were assembled to watch the men come in. Time passed and at 6.0 no man had appeared, the Band still playing and the people still waiting, when it was discovered that they had all crossed the Dutch frontier and gone to join the Belgian army!! and as each carried a flag they were allowed over the Frontier. It is very funny but history does not relate what vengeance the Governor wreaked upon the unfortunate inhabitants. </p>\n<p><em><strong>July 29th</strong></em><br/>\n        Holidays have begun.

Still nowadays with so many millions who wait at home over the same anxiety one almost feels it is a presumption to complain. In the face of so much universal sorrow our own seems like a grain of sand. It is only in one's inward and grey thoughts that one dares to give vent to the horror of it all. </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_11": {"order": 11, "title": "Viewer 11", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/july/Ypres_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><em><strong>Post Cards sent back by Herbert, illustrating the destruction of Ypres... </strong></em></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"454\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"580\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/july/YpresClothHall.jpg\" width=\"454\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"454\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"598\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/july/YpresChurches.jpg\" width=\"454\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n</td>"}}, "errors": [], "description": "\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\n</p>\n<p><span>Wynne has been keeping her diaries since 1895. \n  Her husband is called back to the Front... \n</span></p>\n\n"}, "june": {"viewers": {"viewer_1": {"order": 1, "title": "Viewer 1", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/june/TitlePage_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><span><em><strong>The first page for June in Wynne's  diary..</strong></em></span>.<br/>\n<span><em><strong><br/>\n        As you can see, she has stuck in not only the whole Grenfell poem, but also his obituary notice, and the sonnet Maurice Baring wrote for him after he died, and which was published in the Times:<br/>\n\"Because of you we will  be glad and gay;<br/>\n        Remembering you, we will be brave and strong;<br/>\n        And hail the advent of each dangerous day,<br/>\n        And meet the great adventure with a song.\"<br/>\n      (But the songs were beginning to sound false - after 1915 they became considerably more discordant). </strong></em></span></p>\n<p><em><strong>Grenfell's poem was actually published in the Times on the same day as his obituary.

I had some nice presents, an egg boiler and a blouse from Mother, garden scissors from the children, and \u00a310 from my dear man. The sale at the Vicarage came off on Wednesday 16th, a very hot day and Stella and I worked like blacks. We realized \u00a38.12.0 at our stall and the total was between \u00a370 and \u00a380 so I don't think we did too badly but I am glad it is over. On Friday i went to the Hut which I always love and on my return found my dear man who came down in order to go with me today to Malvern to see our bantling. We started at 9.24 from North Camp and arrived about 1.30 and found Pink awaiting us. <br/>\n<span>(Diary resumes on June 20th)</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0      </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/june/Vanished_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<span><em><strong>An interesting comment on the times...see her comment on this in the June 23rd entry....holiday time! </strong><br/>\n</em></span></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"464\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"1371\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/june/Vanished1_lge.jpg\" width=\"464\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"464\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"766\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/june/Vanished2_lge.jpg\" width=\"464\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><span><em> </em></span></p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_6": {"order": 6, "title": "Viewer 6", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n<p><em>June 20th - 25th</em></p>\n<p>Wynne and her husband visit their son in Malvern School.

Food scarce but not bad, rooms with hardly any furniture, the very hardest bed I've ever met so that one feels quite sore in the morning, and no garden.

Today I've been collecting for the Red Cross. Last week leaflets had to be left at every house in the Parish and today I went to reap where I had sown.

I put here a resume of what he said. Poor Skippy has lost his young half-brother. I knew him so well and always liked him. He was killed on the 16th by shrapnel in the chest and is buried near Ypres.

I often wish this were not so. </p>\n<p><em><strong>March 23rd</strong></em><br/>\n        A day of shopping and to tea came S'Woodie and B.G.S. It seemed odd to have around one our 3 only governesses, 3 different stages of them. </p>\n<p><em><strong>March 24th</strong></em><br/>\n        A lovely day and alas! from 3.30 to 7.30 we played Bridge. I am very fond of the game but I can't bear it before tea, its such rotten waste of time in London too where there are such thousands of things to see and do. No town could be more full of interest than this old village of ours and so many who live here know nothing of it. </p>\n<p><em><strong>March 25th</strong></em><br/>\n        Mother and I spent the morning worting and tidying her linen, such tons of it and in such a feverish muddle it was too! By 2.0 we were at the Colosseum for a grand matinee of all the stars in aid of the Y.M.C.A huts at the Front. The Queen and all the Royal ladies were there and the house was crammed, every item was done by celebrities and we didn't get home till 7.0!</p>\n<p><em><strong>March 26th, Friday</strong></em><br/>\n        I have shopped hard all the morning and continued after lunch to which came Frank looking very well. He and H and the children all went off to the Zoo all the afternoon but I had to be back by 4.0 as Stella S came up. I have indulged in a new coat and skirt, a grey black cloth from Marshalls and I've got to pay 8 guineas for it which I don't like at all!</p>\n<p><em><strong>March 27th</strong></em><br/>\n        To lunch with Mrs Gray taking the children with me, and afterwards all to the Hippodrome where the usual \"Revue\" took place and I must confess I was bored stiff, however they enjoyed it so that was good. I seemed to write nothing about the War these days, somehow now that Poggy is home it lacks interest for me! day after day it continues, the Russians have taken Premszyl but our side seems at a standstill and one is sick of it all. </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_9": {"order": 9, "title": "Viewer 9", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/march/ZepCards_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><em><strong>These are four fascinating cards.

We are coming again tomorrow afternoon in order to see it properly for on Sundays the side chapels are closed. </p>\n<p><em><strong>March 29th</strong></em><br/>\n        We went again to Westminster today but as there is a service every afternoon during this week we could not see round and went instead to the Museum of the United Service Institution. I had never been before to this most interesting place, it is in Whitehall and contains relics of all the great soldiers and sailors and battles of sea and land. There we saw the skeleton of \"Marengo\", Napoleon's favourite white charger. Also his chair that stood beside his bed at St Helena, the cabin furniture of Nelson, many personal effects of Napoleon including his razor and shaving brush found in the carriage he fled in from Waterloo. Cromwell's sword, Sir John Moore's medals, uniform and sash and heaps of other people's possessions besides old models of ships, old weapons, armours etc. We could not tear ourselves away and arrived home about 5.30.</p>\n<p><em><strong>March 30th, Tuesday</strong></em><br/>\n        We have spent the whole morning in Westminster, the children, H, Maby and I, and no words of mine can give any idea of the wonderful interest and beauty of this place. It is curious how one rushed abroad to see St Peter's or St Mark's which though so perfect in their own particular style cannot be said to surpass our wonderful and aged old Abbey. All is perfect, every inch inside and out, and we got hold of a most interesting guide who was full of historical knowledge and not at all guide-bookish. He took us into that superb Henry VII chapel which he in 1503 built and decorated and filled with wealth and treasure and which his son Henry VIII devastated and plundered like he did much else. It has lately had its beautiful flags renewed for it is now dedicated to the Knights of the bath and the gorgeous colours with the sun streaming through on them made a picture to be remembered. What great interest too attaches to the chapel of the Kings, the Confessor's tomb, the chair of \"Scone\" around which tradition and fact are so closely woven, even asserting that the stone was the one on which Jacob had laid his head! but anyway its history begins in 850 when King Malcolm found it in Argyleshire and had it enclosed in a wooden chair and took it to the monastery of Scone in Perthshire, previous to this however it was known to have been brought over from Ireland by one Fergus, King of Scotland, the brother of the then irish King and it was erected at Scolmkil for his coronation. The \"Lea Fail\" or Stone of Destiny it is called and all our Kings and Queens have been crowned on it in that particular chair since the days of Edward 1 who brought it to the Abbey in 1296 and from where it has only once been removed, viz. when Cromwell was made Protector in Westminster Hall. How endless are the things of interest, the various chapels and monuments, the quaint old wax effigies of famous people, many taken from death masks all in the actual clothes they wore at their death or on some other occasion and carried at the head of the funeral procession and then kept until the monument was made. I was much interested in the malicious, cruel and yet sad face of Elizabeth, and much disappointed in the smug <span>(face)</span> of Mary Stuart who I had always imagined fragile and beautiful. William is just what one would imagine though and as for Queen Anne you can see in her cow-like and placid face the 19 children all of whom are buried here. Our guide showed and let us feel a gruesome thing. Long years ago the old chapel of the Norman Undercroft was used as a Kings Treasury and robbery being detected it was traced to one of the monks. Forthwith they flayed him alive and nailed his skin upon the door and there behind the iron clasps you still can feel it like a piece of hard wood! I don't believe hardly anyone knows about this! but I must not ramble on anymore**. </p>\n<p><em><strong>March 31st</strong></em><br/>\n        Win returns today and H and I went to meet her, having done so we all went off to the City and wandered about in that strange and interesting place, then lunched and did more shopping, returning to the flat for tea. H and I dined with our dear Norman and Blanche Gray and talked endless shop which is manna to me these days!</p>\n<p>**(Sadly for Wynne this lovely story has just been disproved - the skin is in fact that of a cow. However in the process of testing this old door, something more remarkable was discovered. It is in fact the oldest door in England, dating from around 1050, and therefore of Anglo Saxon origin. That dating was worked out from taking wood samples which showed that the tree it is made from grew between 924 -1030 AD, and the door, before it was cut down for the Undercroft, was probably an important one, possibly in use for the Chapter House. )</p>\n<p>\u00a0      </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_11": {"order": 11, "title": "Viewer 11", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/march/Westminster_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><em><strong>The Abbey as Wynne saw it, from cards taken from the Diary...check out <a href=\"http://www.westminster-abbey.org\">westminster abbey website</a> for the Abbey today.

Today for the first time for years it would have been possible to be Queen of the May in muslin, but there is no peace in which to enjoy it. The papers fill one with gloom and doubt. Today there is a wonderful account of the Canadians bravery at Ypres in face of these awful odds, what losses but what gallantry, the Dominions will well be proud. The latest invention of the Germans is poisonous gases and shells, and the men not being able to breath are naturally overcome. What will the devils think of next. Mysterious shells have now been fired on Dunkirk and no one seems to know from where. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 2nd</em></strong><br/>\n        These piteous appeals keep coming from Holland <span><em>(see previous page, with the letter she mentions)</em></span>. They read like a Baboo's letter <span><em>(a reference to the Indian babu or minor official often encountered on journeys in India)</em></span> and if there were not tragedy behind it it would be very funny. I got a consignment of bulbs in the autumn from the same man - I'm bound to say they weren't much use but they came so late. I've sent for this lot and shall see if I have better luck. I've spent a long idle day by myself, just I and the children. It has been one of \"blues\" for me, thank goodness I don't often get them but today everything seemed stale and unprofitable and I was glad when it was over. </p>\n<p><em><strong>May 3rd</strong></em><br/>\n        I wound up my Mothers' Meetings today and Oh! what a blessed relief it is, for though I have escaped a good many it has seemed a long season this year.</p>\n<p><em><strong>May 4th</strong></em><br/>\n        Today Pink and I set forth to Swanage leaving by the 10.2 train which we all but missed through an error of Turner's overzealous boy who countermanded Walker! On arrival in Town we went straight to Guys Hospital where we at last ran Herman to earth, he poor chap home again, wounded this time in the leg but as the bullet passed clean through it will I hope not be too serious. We caught the 2.0 from W.Loo and on arrival at S 5.15 were met by H <span><em>(her husband, not Herman)</em></span> with whom we walked up the shore having sent our baggage to the hotel. Its lovely to be with him again and this is a very comfortable old place run by 3 old Miss Vincents, excellent food, good rooms and all very clean. The charge during summer season is three and a half guineas a week, without baths and morning tea. It is full of soldier folk of course as every hole and corner is now. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 5th</em></strong><br/>\n        As H is of course pretty busy we do not see much of him except at meal times, so we shall spend our day in exploring the coast line and country. Today we walked to Durleston Bay and found the same spot where we used to go 12 years ago when we were here before and Pink was a few months old and where one finds certain tiny shells. It seems so odd being here again and he now twelve and a half years old! After lunch we went the opposite way towards Old Harry, trudging along a very shingly beach and climbing over chalk boulders at the end, a lonely and bogey spot it seemed to me. </p>\n<p><em><strong>May 6th, Thursday</strong></em><br/>\n        Today my son and I walked over to Studland, and Oh! what a climb it is, and how hot. We found the little place almost empty and really not much altered from the old days. We had tea at the Banks Arms, now called \"The Hotel\" and I gazed up with affectionate remembrance at the cave where Adie <span><em>(Maclean)</em></span> slept a hundred years ago!</p>\n<p><em><strong>May 7th, Friday</strong></em><br/>\n        The weather still being perfect we made another lovely expedition. As my man was out at a field day we took our lunch in a basket and went away along the coast past Tilly Whim and the Lighthouse as far as Dancing Ledge. The pathway lay all along the top of the cliffs. I should have enjoyed it more if it hadn't for I find my nerves for precipices is entirely gone! and it makes me feel bogeyish! The view was perfect and the general air of peace hard to reconcile with the scenes of unutterable confusion being enacted across the water. The bluest of seas and skies, the faintest breeze and the very cry of the seabirds completed the beauty of it. We found a whole field full of \"bee orchis\" which we have sent to Mary. On arriving at Dancing Ledge an eerie lonely old quarry, we ate our lunch and I felt bogeyish so far away from the world. We found various fossils and crystals for Noots' collection and wandered home at our leisure getting back about 4.15. </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_3": {"order": 3, "title": "Viewer 3", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/may/Pink_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><em><strong><br/>\n      Wynne's son at Swanage - and a party out on the water....</strong></em></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"462\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"337\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/may/Pink_Swanage.jpg\" width=\"462\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"400\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"260\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/may/Swanage_boat.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</td>"}, "viewer_4": {"order": 4, "title": "Viewer 4", "excerpt": "\n\n\n<p><em>\n            May 8th - 11th</em></p>\n<p>Wynne marvels at the new volunteers in training and notes the loss of the Lusitania. \"The Germans are making desperate efforts and using the most foul and abominable methods...\"</p>\n\n", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<span><strong></strong></span></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>May 8th</strong></em><br/>\n        I forgot to mention that on Thursday I saw in the paper that poor Pussie Gowans has lost her man, died of wounds, and a curious coincidence occurred for on that very morning I lost my cigarette case which she gave me 14 years ago.<br/>\n        We went up today to watch some driving near barracks which H was judging, and after lunch <a href=\"http://www.wynnesdiary.com/1915_pages/july/viewer_1.html\">Capt Gore Browne</a>, H's Staff Captain, motored us over to East Holme to watch the regimental sports of the 78th Brigade who are out there in camp. It seemed so funny to see that crowd of Tommies doing exactly the same things as one has seen at dozens of other regimental sports, one could not realize that a few months ago all these men were clerks, labourers etc and their officers whatever may be their abilities or lack of them.

At about 12 H's kind Staff Captain took us off in this motor and where we didn't go I cant tell! for we only got back at 6.0 having lunched at Ringwood and tea'd of all places at the Kings Head, Wimborne in which I've never been since our wedding just on 14 years ago! It did seem funny being there. The country is looking its very best, wreathed in green tracery, bluebells and primroses, and I am now longing to settle in these parts for good and all! The hills are large and bare, being down land, but the valleys are full of woods and lanes and its all so friendly and homey. </p>\n<p><em><strong>May 10th, Monday</strong></em><br/>\n        This day 20 years ago I was confirmed, Oh! what a century ago it seems since I drove with Father in the brougham, Mother and Eve following in the dog cart to Spettisbury Church!<br/>\n        This is Monday and I'm forgetting to mention that on Sat. all were horrified to hear that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania\">Lusitania</a> coming from New York was torpedoed off Kinsale Head with a loss of 1500 lives. What will America do now? Many eminent people were on board including Mr Vanderbilt, Charles Frohman, Elbert Hubbard the great American philanthropist preacher and Sir Hugh Lane etc...no warning and in 10 minutes she sank. Its too awful to think about even. We went to pick flowers this morning and retuned with armfuls of bluebells, cowslips and campion which I sent to the Mission in Town, but previous to this H came with us and we looked over such a charming old house called <a href=\"http://www.amazing-places.co.uk/amazing_places_newtown_manor.html\">Newton Manor</a>, once the home of a certain Sir J.C. Robinson, a great art critic and collector. He died about 2 years ago and his son too and so it is on the market but alas soldiers have been billeted there all the winter and the place smells of Tommies and is filthy inside but could be made so lovely and has been, and the garden is quite sweet. They want 6000 for it, absurd, they'll never get it. <br/>\n        In the afternoon I had to have a tea party, so many of our people have called that I felt I ought to get to know them. It seemed so strange being at that old game again! There are some interesting people staying here, a Mr and Mrs Penrose, he was a great medical man and is now a scientist in general. Joy upon joys they've lent us their car for the next two days!</p>\n<p><em><strong>May 11th, Tuesday</strong></em><br/>\n        I got my mail this morning. Ell sailed on the 25th and expects to arrive at Marseilles on the 15th. God protect him - this is an awful time. I don't write very much of the War, it is all too frightful. The Germans are making desperate efforts on every side and using the most foul and abominable methods of attaining their end. They are not to be enjoyed, these people, with their high Kultur of gas poisoning, well poisoning, and torpedoing. It is all sickening. Zeps came over Southend yesterday and dropped 100 bombs killing only one person but destroying a good many houses. They are getting nearer and nearer London, these raids. Well this morning a most perfect car came round for us costing at least \u00a3100,000,000! and we went to a lovely place called Worbarrow Bay. Never shall I forget this most lovely drive. The country lying warm and still in its fresh Spring green and we passed through many little old world villages, the old grey stone slated cottages and their gardens aglow with brilliant May tulips making pictures of themselves. The very names: Grange Creech Knowle, having an old world sound. After an hours run we came to Worbarrow, a most beautiful secluded Bay, in which we found 2 bungalows and a few fisher cottages. We clambered about and paddled and fell in! and made an impromptu acquaintance of some children and a lady called Draper. Pinkie played with the former whilst the latter took me up to the little house they have built there and kindly gave me tea! Near by was a wood literally a carpet of bluebells and Star of Bethlehem, where nightingales sang loudly and I felt, Oh!, why Oh! why cant I live here instead of our most pogbaggish neighbourhood of which I am utterly sick. </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/may/The-Wind_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"490\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"1488\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/may/The-Wind_lge.jpg\" width=\"490\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_6": {"order": 6, "title": "Viewer 6", "excerpt": "\n\n\n<p>\n<span><em>May 12th - 18th</em></span></p>\n<p>Leaves Swanage...\"a most fearful battle has been going on round Ypres.

It has been a horribly gloomy day but I've gardened hard to keep myself away from thinking too much. </p>\n<p><em><strong>May 21st</strong></em><br/>\n        Stella and I have been shopping in Town today for our stall at this wretched Bazaar which comes off in June. Oh! how I hate it. My dear man arrived tonight for 2 days leave. </p>\n<p><strong>May 22nd </strong><br/>\n        I have been busy showing the man the new papers in the house and garden, it is just a snatch at happiness having him home, it is nearly a year since he first left now and it will be long unless something unforeseen occurs till he comes to live at home again, not that I would have him live at home now when the world is at work. He too would hate it. </p>\n<p><em><strong>May 23rd, Sunday</strong></em><br/>\n        Tis Whitsundtide and never I suppose did one need God's Spirit more than at the present time, more and more get drawn into this fierce conflict and Italy is in the balance.

We sat and lazed in the garden this afternoon, it was warm in the shelter but such a wind blowing still. </p>\n<p><em><strong>May 24th</strong></em><br/>\n        Very few people are making holiday today I fancy, it would be an insult to play cricket, football, tennis or go racing and thank goodness all these things are stopped.

Accordingly I went and till 5.30 we served refreshments and smokes as hard as we could go. Tea, coffee, buns, cake, chocolate etc all to be had for 1d a piece. Books, papers, writing materials and so on all provided free. Whilst we were there who should come in to pay a surprise visit but the King and Queen with Princess Mary, Princess Victoria, Queen Alexandra and the Empress Eugenie - the men were amazed! They went all round and after they had left the Queen sent back Lady Haig to say she had not realized that we ladies were serving or she would have spoken to us. I wish she had, it would have been so interesting. Rather an amusing thing happened, one fellow was asleep to whom as they passed the two Queens made bows and as he slowly roused himself Princess Mary laughingly said: \"Get up, the King is passing\" and he being half asleep replied: \"The King.

After this frivolity I, having met and been introduced to her in the morning, went to tea with Mrs Ferguson, a nice lady who lives at Lawday House.

Natheless <span>(sic)</span> I sped forth on my iron steed at 2.0 to take up a new job I have. I am working on Monday and Wednesday afternoons at the Parish Room in Aldershot where a War Supply Depot has been formed for hospital necessaries. Attired in large white aprons, head squares and sleevlets we all sit round making swobs, bandages, pneumonia jackets etc which eventually go up to Cavendish House. It is very interesting and as one sits there working one thinks of the hundreds of other women so employed all the world over. I have often heard Mother speak of how they used to work in like manner during the Franco-Prussian war. History repeats itself.

I went and attended a vile committee meeting re Yolland House at the Vicarage at 12 and also with the aid of the children spent a long time gathering the Skippy's medlar crop which once again they have given me. H writes that they are having much rain and their part of the country is fearful already. There are so few houses standing that the men are all in dug-outs and one sub had his fall in on him one night. </p>\n<p><em><strong>November 3rd</strong></em><br/>\n        Thank goodness the weather has cheered up, a lovely day and the wind has dried the roads. In to my Hospital work and whilst there who should arrive to my great surprise but Herman having flown over from Bristol to Farnborough. He is now training at the Filton School and expects to get his wings in about a month's time. Being my hut night I could not unfortunately return with him and the kind Skippys gave him dinner for me and I got back about 9.45 and had my supper and then we talked till 11.0. He can only stay the night and goes off early tomorrow. He is looking awfully well. I heard at the hut tonight that our Highlanders are to leave again - we shall miss them very much, such a gentlemanly crowd. </p>\n<p><em><strong>November 4th</strong></em><br/>\n        Herman left this morning early taking Walker to the station as he returns to Bristol by train.

H in his letter today has also heard it, alas how much it adds to our anxiety because of the uncertainty of it. Well she wanted me to go up so after my Hut duty I went by the 6.30, arrived three quarters of an hour late and didn't get to the flat until 8.30. How can I describe the look of London as I stepped out of the High St Underground. Almost complete darkness met me, hardly a light from any window, only every other street lamp lit and that at half cock and painted black leaving a small square through which the apology for light spread itself in a small pool on the pavement immediately below.

Several of the gun emplacements were under water when I went round this morning, dugouts fallen in and everyone in a somewhat disconsolate state. It is so difficult to know what to do, the country seems impossible to drain properly, the ditches which ought to carry off the water are generally stopped up somewhere though there are rises in the ground there doesn't seem to be any flow. I found both the Infantry Brigades in distress, one's office was tumbling down. the other's had streams of water flowing through it.\"<br/>\n        Poor things, what discomfort and why don't they all die of rheumatism. He also writes me something of the Native troops which disgusts one and which makes one realize that its quite time they were removed. One of their comp. told one of his officers that 40 of his men had deserted to the enemy. The Germans throw grenades into their trenches with letters inside saying any native that goes over will be treated with great kindness and so some deluded wretches have taken them at their word and will in all probability be fighting in the Turkish army before very long.<br/>\n<span>(Wynne does not say who these troops are, or indeed quite how this was achieved - presumably the pin was not pulled from the grenades! In fact the \"native\" troops suffered terrible hardships, were often inadequately clad and were not prepared for this sort of warfare. Many of them fought with extraordinary courage, in a war that had nothing to do with them at all.)</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>November 10th</strong></em><br/>\n        A fine day, Hurrah! and off to the Hospital Depot and Hut, such a busy night I simply couldn't cope with it and had to get Mrs Hill to help me at my cakes. </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/november/Poem_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<span><em><strong>Stuck into November 19th, I have not come across this poem in other anthologies - Wynne clearly valued it.

It was such a nice letter and he said the men were devoted to him, and would have followed him anywhere, but the actual date was not given nor any other details and one does long to know he did not suffer. </p>\n<p><em><strong>October 4th</strong></em><br/>\n        I spent a busy morning cleaning all sorts of things in my little room, the brasses in particular.

I have received from H a most interesting relic, a beautiful wine glass from Ypres. It has a milk hair thread running down the stem. I am pleased and proud, also some sweet lace collars which I've given to the children. All these things are so awfully precious to me, they will increase in value and interest as the time goes on.

What strange reading it all is, with talk of future plans etc., for a fortnight before we were quietly house hunting in Suffolk with a view of leaving this house last Sept. year! A lot of water has run under the bridge since then and what untold horrors and grief have occurred in one year's time.

The persistent refusal of the Govt. to give the country conscription, necessitating the unavailing efforts of the individual to replace it by other schemes, added to which we now have an \" appeal by the King\" to the manhood of the Nation, is little short of humiliating and one only has to read \"Through German Eyes\" in the Times to see what they think of us.

One realizes in what a position we stand when Greece, though offered by us as a concession the island of Cyprus, can afford to ignore the offer and give us to understand that Germany has called at her door before us. Serbia, poor valiant little nation, is getting a hammering from Austria, Germany and Bulgaria and no news is heard of our Ex.

He is looking very well and it is so delightful seeing him again. He has 7 days leave after 13 months absence. My days are spent between letters, chickens, house and the Hut, to which I go 3 nights and one afternoon a week. On Saturday Win came too and we were there from 11 until 5.30 the morning being spent in cleaning, dusting and tidying. The Tommy who plays so beautifully, Mr Burgess, a former professor of music at Oxford, was there practicing and it seemed strange to be scrubbing tables to the accompaniment of the classics! We lunched at the Hut in the storeroom off ham sandwiches and lemonade and thoroughly enjoyed it. Herbert writes that one of his guns has been fitted up as an aircraft gun and the other day they brought down an aeroplane, splendid luck for the gunner.

She comes often with me now and is very useful. I go again tomorrow but the weather has broken and I do hope its not going to last as bicycling at night in the wet is so horrible. It has been a miserable day and so cheerless and cold. I bicycled into Farnham this morning to get a new blue apron having lost mine out of the basket coming home last night. In the Hut I noticed a lot of tiny soldiers, none of them over 5 foot I should think, and on enquiring who these strange dwarfs might be I was informed that they belonged to the Bantam Battalion of the Welsh Fusiliers and South Wales Borderers who came in a few days ago.</p>\n<p><em><strong>September 15th</strong></em><br/>\n        Another cold wet day and tonight coming from the YMCA it rained quite heavily and blew in my face, most horrible and I am rather wondering how I am going to face the winter night rides, it'll be rather a problem but I do so hope I'll be able to carry it on. </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/september/Zepp_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong><em>This is the letter from Wynne's mother about the bombing raid - in retrospect it all seems so innocent and extraordinary, given what we came to expect later.<br/>\n        Notice the black-bordered funereal writing paper - a pretty general requirement for people at that time. </em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"350\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"446\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/september/ZeppLetter.jpg\" width=\"357\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"350\">\n<tr>\n<td>Dearest Darling<br/>\n          Today I have something to relate - last night at 10.30 Bessie was just brushing my hair when BoomBoomBoom in quick succession a terrific noise suddenly came, then a lot of firing, 2 machine guns going - I looked out and there slowly and quietly coming along quite low and it looked just 2 streets off was a huge Zeppeline <em>(sic)</em> our aircraft like wasps all round - She dropping bombs and firing from a small cloud of smoke.

Poor maid. I've been spending sometime ready over my diary of 1913, how full those days seemed but compared with these, full of emptiness. Think of the simple serenity of it all, one round of pleasures mixed with parochial duties and yet how busy one seemed, but now, how altered everything is. Oh! the hideousness of these awful times, the never- ending good-byes, the anxious days and nights, never knowing what you may hear next, the weary waiting and the deathly tiredness that comes over one at times as the days go on and more and more are drawn into the fearful conflict. Now both Bulgaria and Greece are in arms, the former to join with Germany and the latter with the Allies. The Russians continue to retreat, the fighting at the Dardanelles gets no forwarder, and our Western Front in spite of persistent rumours of a big move etc remains the same. A line I had from Bill two days ago said \" Dont worry about Herbert, he will not be in\", nothing more, and H himself writes that every day they hear heavy sounds of firing down south but don't know who it is. <span>(This was the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Loos\"> Battle of Loos</a>)</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>September 27th and 28th</strong></em><br/>\n        A vile microbe has come here - my Noot has been so bad and so has my vile body.

The sound of persistent bombardment down south heard by H for 48 hours is now explained. A great attack has been planned and carried out by us and the French together, we apparently made headway of some considerable distance, captured about 2000 prisoners and 15 guns whilst the French in Champagne penetrated much further capturing and disabling 20,000 and 79 guns. Both our men are safe. H's Division was not directly used but Ell was pretty well in it all, and his job was guarding prisoners because the man who was told off to do it was such a bad linguist. He said the mob who passed through his hands were a miserable crowd, knees through their breeches and boots tied on with string and all nearly boys. Oh! how one does just hope we follow it up. </p>\n<p><em><strong>September 30th</strong></em><br/>\n        This morning amongst my letters there was one from Rita, on opening it I was stricken to read that dear Brownie was killed in action on or about the 25th or 26th. It is a great loss to me, he and I have always been such pals for years and now the life has gone to make up like countless others the sum total of this most hideous war. Only about ten days ago he was here spending the day with Aim being home on 7 days leave and his last letter to me must have been written only about three days before he died. Thank God Ell and H still are well but the times are indeed anxious and one dreads the next day. The weather has turned horribly cold just like winter and oh, the poor men soon will be freezing again. </p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"188\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"233\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1915/september/BillandHerman.jpg\" width=\"188\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><br/>\n<span>(Brownie is Bill Fallowfield, Wynne's cousin.

I took the children to tea at the Todds, a lovely evening, and we walked home across the Park. Our way led us past the statue of Peter Pan. Whilst gazing at his loveliness a soldier and his girl came up, \"What is it supposed to be\" she asked. \"The Pipes of Pan of course\" he replied, good enough for Punch.

It is a great surprize and a very jolly one. I had to go to the Club to meet a woman, then for tea, but hied me back pretty soon.

When he had gone we made our way to see Westminster, Win and Pink never having been round it before. A lot of the most precious things have been <a href=\"http://www.wynnesdiary.com/1919_pages/march/viewer_1.html\">removed for safety</a>, the Coronation Chair, precious glass etc and many of the ancient tombs are completely sand-bagged so that one cant see them at all.

I enjoyed getting it so awfully, he was fairly well but found the Tigris water a trial and gave a description of the engagement of 9-10th March which alas was a failure. He himself was hit by shrapnel but by God's mercy it only bruised him. His description of their life and hardships fill one with dread but he says actually very little, only one can read between the lines. </p>\n<p><em><strong>April 29th</strong></em><br/>\n        The weather leaves nothing to be desired, its very hot and very lovely and one regrets the passing of every day but ... is one really in sympathy with it for this year \"we carry our own winter with us everywhere\". I have sufficient excuse to talk about carrying winter with us for this evening the tragic news has come to hand of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kut\">Fall of Kut</a>. Never has there been a more tragic drama acted before our eyes. For months and months this devoted garrison has held out in a dirty little Arab town against appalling odds and at last no food was left. A relief ship sent a few days ago supposedly ran the gauntlet of the Turkish guns only to be stopped within 4 miles of the town by a sand bank - irony of fate - and on the 27th or 28th april Gen. Townshend had to surrender. He has been allowed to retain his sword and the sick and wounded are to be exchanged altogether the Turk has behaved like a gentleman. The force - 4 Generals, 277 British Officers, 274 Indian ditto and 13,300 men are to be marched to Anatolia wherever that may be. One's heart aches at it all and to think of the hundreds of lives lost in the efforts to relieve the Town all for nothing. Our anxieties for Ell still continue, his daily danger we cannot fail to appreciate, but there is a God over all. </p>\n<p><em><strong>April 30th, Sunday</strong></em><br/>\n      The heat continues.

I was not happy - when i got to Amara they wanted to shove me into Hospital but I told them to be blowed and crept on shore and the cool night on shore did me a lot of good.

We had a successful expedition and I think he was quite satisfied, the house is certainly charming but the garden alas leaves much to be desired. It is of course in very rough condition having been entirely neglected for 2 years. The lawns have been down for hay, all the roses have run to riot and there is very little in it at all. Moreover there are no large trees, a great disadvantage, but one cant have everything. Mrs Southy was there and so we were able to fix up everything. We put up at Crewkerne in the principal hotel and were very comfortable and had a very nice landlord but what a journey back! It was awful. The heat intense and every train so late that we lost all our connections and got home finally at 10.0! Poggy stayed till Monday and left by the 12.08. It has been a very busy fortnight since he left. I've been working at the Stanhope Hut and it is a desperately full one, situated as it is in the middle of the lines. Most <span><em>(of the men)</em></span> are RE and Middlesex, a rough crowd and not nearly such a good class as the Alexandra lot who are mostly RAMC. The work too is much more strenuous and by the end of the evening in this great heat our feet seem several sizes larger than they should be. I am writing in the Park. The children are busy playing in the stream, damming up and making a deep pool. I hear their high piping voices shrieking out the most ridiculous make believe conversations. Noot calls the loads she brings for the dam \"contribulations\"! It is very lovely here and so peaceful one simply can't realize that not so very far off men are fighting and killing, each side trying to out do the other. Even here in this solitude the sound of firing from the rifle ranges comes as a sharp reminder that more and more men are training for this awful devils game. It's all too cruel, the slaughter goes on and on. Last week I saw that Charlie Hughes Gibb had been killed, this week Major Cavendish and today Joc writes me that her eldest brother Graham was killed on the 4th - so it goes on. We have been anxious too about Ell - for a month no letter or wire but 2 days ago came a wire saying \"All right, leaving for India\". We cannot think what it means and only hope he goes on duty and not through ill health, but such horrible things happen one never can be at ease, anyhow its a blessed relief to think him away from that awful hole. Today Mother sent me a letter from him dated June 23rd which arrived yesterday. I have copied it out and stick it in here. It speaks for itself. He had been down with sunstroke which is not surprizing since the temp. at night had been up to 139\u00b0. Surely that must be a record. No one will ever know what these men have gone through out there and to what end? The whole thing has been another huge failure as the Dardanelles was, everything a muddle and hundreds of lives lost to no purpose. Oh! it does make one's blood boil. <br/>\n      I am alone with the children at present. Win is visiting the Maynards in Devon and Pink is with the Gwythers in Cornwall, lucky beggars, how we three do pine for the sea, but I am glad that they are both having such a good time. Mother comes on Monday and H I think for the weekend. Pink returns on Friday 18th. Meanwhile the weather is perfect, very hot for working, and what with hutting <span><em>(working at the Army Hut)</em></span> and potato crop gathering its been a pretty hard week but here its lovely. I am very busy with various things connected with our move, writing endless letters, selling the brougham, the coal etc...Robins has bought the brougham for \u00a32!!! its positively humourous but one get nothing for them these day.

You do get rather tired of bully beef and hard tack as the staple diet, tho' the transport really works wonders when you come to consider things. Of course there are Y.M.C.A.s, canteens etc scattered around this country in the most surprising places but when you get there the stock is usually down to cigarettes, tobacco and biscuits. Also we do not get very much time for going out as we are in the trenches daily or nightly as the case may be. Not having enough R.E.s to go round, each division now has a pioneer battalion to supplement them. Which said toil and travail we are performing at present and will continue to do so until this trench warfare is over. <br/>\n        It is not so bad in a way as we are in billets about a couple of miles behind our front line trenches and go up daily or nightly to our work. Of course the drawback is that though we have to expose ourselves <br/>\n        most of the time to the tender mercies of Fritz we have no come back on him as we are not allowed to fire back. Our only chance will be when we have a general advance and then we will be able to pay back a few old scores. <br/>\n        Of course the worst things out here are the mud and general dirtiness. Water too is for some unaccountable reason rather scarce and all the drinking water is reinforced with chlorine of lime that is not very nice. Still on the whole we are all pretty happy in a way but it is inevitable that everybody should long for the end of the war. But still, nobody seems to contemplate peace at all except under one condition and that is the unconditional surrender of Germany. <br/>\n        Tho' things here are supposed to be quiet as compared to the Somme it is quite lively enough for us. Fritz too is at a distinct disadvantage - our artillery is immensely superior to his both in weight and numbers and for every shot he sends over we return about 10. Our aeroplanes are about all day but Fritz seems to be either very very modest or deficient in this commodity which must be a great handicap to his artillery. We are also continually sending over raiding parties to his trenches which parties rarely come back empty handed. Last night we had a series of raiding parties organised all over the front. The two brigades in our part of the line took between them 329 prisoners which was a pretty good nights work. <br/>\n        The really curious part of all is this, that once you get a couple of miles behind the trenches you would hardly know that there was a war going on. It is true that there are batteries of guns in the midst of standing crops but the crops are there and they are being harvested too. In the villages most of the houses are of course rather knocked to pieces but still there are quite a few little shops doing business. Where they get their stocks from is a mystery to me. Still it is very hard to get anything nice. <br/>\n        Souvenirs consist as a rule of extremely patriotic silk-embroidered postcards, silk handkerchiefs covered with the Allied flags in bunches and similar atrocities. The first week we were billeted just inside the communication trenches in a nunnery but my diligent searches were only rewarded with an extremely dull and worthless theological treatise printed in 1641. It was not worth taking away, especially as it was very bulky. <br/>\n        Did you ever come across a Colonel Ironsides? He is chief of staff to General Watson who is in command of our division. If you had met him you would remember him. I think his deeds will become legendary amongst this division, but the tales are too long for a letter. His speciality is the catching and treatment of German spies. <br/>\n        Mother enjoyed her stay with you very much and must have had quite a gay time. She does find it a relief to be able to do as she wishes and not to be tied to an old man of the sea. I suppose you will be pretty busy just now on account of moving. How does Pinkie like Wellington? Remember me to the children if they remember me - I am sorry I did not send you my contribution to Gran's stone any sooner but did not know that you had definitely arranged anything. I enclose it in this letter. I hear Herbert is keeping fit. Remember me to him if he is down on leave - I expect he is pretty busy just now.

One's brains get \"furbed\" up with it all and one gets on the other hand utterly weary of reiterating the progress of a War that is seemingly endless. Nevertheless before another month passes and leaves behind it another year of misery and anxiety I am determined to put in a bit more just to give a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of our very thrilling life! As will be seen by my address by anyone who happens to light on this we are now settled in this house in far Somerset. Arrangements as to Agreement etc being fixed up we accordingly moved here on October 6th, that is to say, I , Martha and Cathy with Peter Vyell and a rabbit, and were followed next day by Win. The move was a great piece of work and I missed my man in more ways than one. To put it briefly I am charmed with the house and surrounding country whilst the garden is vile, the hot water arrangements ditto and our landlady \"tres dificile\". During the move I sent the children and Maby to Mother where they stayed for 3 weeks, in due course I gathered in a parlour and between maid and so far all goes very well. I am more than busy all day and every day and having got the house straight my time is now entirely devoted to the garden which from a howling wilderness is slowly becoming more civilized. I shall never care much for it as its too plain and straight but there is much in many other ways to commend the place and I am as happy as any one can be these days. There is in the village a local Hospital, a portion of Lord Poullet's house which he has given to the Red Cross, and there Win goes to work being enrolled in the V.A.D. for General Service. We have got to know all the men very well and 4 come down to tea every Saturday. I have no regular War work now so am glad to be able to \"do my bit\" in this way. They are very easy to amuse and we play games with them till 6.0 when they have to be escorted home. I am longing for Spring to come, I hear it is lovely here and that there are masses of Primroses everywhere. I do not regret leaving Hale at all save for some few very nice friends there. I also shall not forget some very jolly times there but I always hated the horrible neighbourhood with that vile Aldershot so near and I never want in all my life to return! <br/>\n        Our last month there was a very full one. We were 13 - 14 nearly all the time and there was much coming and going between us and the A.S.C. Mess where Tom Swayne was commandant. They played tennis at our house nearly every day and we were up there a lot as well, but no, I don't want to go back at all, this war has filled it with associations of nameless anxieties into the bargain and I'm glad we quitted. <br/>\n        Now the \"Society\" of Hinton reminds me of Miss Mitford's \"Our Village\" <span><em>(see note at page bottom)</em></span>. We are far removed from the world and here \"move and have their being\" some odd dozen of so of people who go to make up a real old world community. The owner of the place and surrounding property is Lord Poullet who is away fighting. When we first came down here his Lady and her children were here and came to call before they left for Town for the winter. She, Lady P, was an actress, Silvia Storey by name, daughter of Fred Storey, an amiable lady apparently but just of the people. <span><em>(Wynne has not spelt the name correctly - Sylvia Storey was a member of the London Gaiety Theatre company and married Earl Poulett in 1908...again, note correct spelling. Their son was born in 1909, and lived until 1973, after which the title died out. Earl Poulett fought in the war as a Captain in the Royal Horse Artillery, and died on 11th July 1918. The funeral is covered in the July 1918 diary)</em></span>.<br/>\n        She <span><em>(Lady Poulett)</em></span> asked us to tea one day and we went taking the children. Words fail me when I would describe the beauty of that house, it dates chiefly from Inigo Jones and it contains the most beautiful tapestries, pictures, furniture and china anyone ever saw. I shall never forget the beauty of the room in which we had tea, immense in its proportions it rises in the centre to a huge glass dome, its walls are oak-panelled and hung with enormous tapestries, round it stand numbers of beautiful old Chinese cabinets, lovely chairs and antique tables covered with china. At one end was an enormous open hearth with big steel fire dogs and a blaze of logs. Her Ladyship, dressed like one's great great grandmother after the fashion of the present day, also sat in the centre dispensing tea from amidst a mass of sliver which betrayed an experienced \"Butler's Thumb\". Her small children are charming, quite un-airified and well mannered and one day before they left they came here to tea. <br/>\n        The first to call here was a Mrs Lowe, she is a sort of Queen of the Village, and with her daughter Miss Dorothy Lowe lives in a little old house in the village,the wife of an Archdeacon and the mother of many scholastic sons and daughters. Miss Dorothy is doing Commandant at the Hospital and has a very busy time. Then there is Mrs Dolling who has lived here for 52 years and whose husband and son were both Rectors of the parish and who is very very poor and lives in a tiny house which was converted from a labourer's cottage. Another lady is Mrs Pardoe, also I believe a clergyman's widow, of her I know little. She came to call with Mrs Dolling and is doing masseuse at the Hospital. Round the corner by the church live the two Miss Coles, too poor to keep a servant at all, a couple of old maids rich in gossip and who when they came to call warned me of the various things I must not mention to this person or that, valuing my discretion I fancy as much as I valued theirs! but amongst all this collection of old Pussies we are not wanting in our \"worldly element\" for there is Mr Love, a man of 43, a land agent whose Father was the same before him and who has lived here for many years. He is quite the \"man of the world\", is away a great deal on business and when at home lives also in a tiny house (all the houses are tiny) with his old housekeeper and devoted slave, Harriet. It is all rather like Cranford and many are the strange histories and old world stories connected with the place and the inhabitants thereof. We are lucky in having a very nice church, old as the hills and filled with monuments and memorials of the Poullet <span><em>(sic)</em></span> family. Our parson is an earnest Churchman, a little pious but sincere. The services are well attended and the singing (Miss Coles plays the organ) very bright and nice and it is a blessed relief after the gloom of Hale and its coldness and emptiness. I have long gossips with my gardener, he being over age so far has not been called thank goodness. He is a real character and keeps me in fits of silent laughter. The tales I hear about one and all would turn the subject of them green with amazement. Lots of people have called, too many for my liking as its difficult getting about on one's bicycle these busy days and in the fearful weather we have had so much of since our arrival here. Distances are great too and the roads are very hilly. Mrs Lowe took me to Illminster in her car the other day to attend a sale of work. There I saw assembled crowds of other old Pussies all buying wool mats, dish cloths, string bags, print garments and the like and I was introduced to one after the other until I felt myself positively furry! but everyone seems awfully kind and pleasant in these parts and in the summer one will see more of people. <br/>\n<span><em>(Note: Miss Mitford, or Mary Russell Mitford, turned to writing to support a profligate father who had managed to waste a large inheritance.

Rumania has practically succumbed, the Germans have occupied the capital and overrun the country, capturing thousands of prisoners and stores of all sorts; chaos prevails in Greece, a hideous reign of terror, civil war and unimagined cruelty all round, what a seething mass of horror and sadness the Balkans always are, and the larger powers seem able to do nothing. </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1916/december/Ell_letter_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<span><em><strong>This is a letter from Wynne's brother, convalescing in Ootacamund in India - its five pages is typical of the sort of letters they wrote to each other.

Every morning we awake to find the world a sea of hoar frost, every leaf and twig glistens and a great stillness reigns, it would be very beautiful if it were not so deadly. I don't think I've ever experienced such cold before in my life, and it goes on so long. Yesterday not being able to work in the garden I went for a long walk to Dinnington with Maby, Win and the children. The air was biting but everywhere a great stillness prevailed and how shall I describe the beauty of the scene - the whole land was one sheet of white crystals, the fir trees looked like gigantic ostrich plumes, the larches like uncurled ones and it looked extraordinary to peer into the depth of the woods and see every twig and branch looking like a crystal. Great frosted spider webs covered all the barns and the lichen covered apple trees in the hollow at Dinnington looked like bearded old men. We gathered large branches of mistletoe which grows in profusion there and as we strode along the ground crackled under our feet and the trees and hedges crackled above us. It was a perfect sight, one I shall never forget, but I do not enjoy this weather, its too painful. Today I had to make an expedition into Yeovil and bicycling in such low temperatures almost hurts one to breathe. The reason I went in arose from a curious coincidence. For some time Maby had been in negotiation with a Mrs Wilkinson and last week was asked by her to meet a sister-in-law in Yeovil and who should it turn out to be but Dot Sealy! and so I went in to meet her today. It was so very nice and she doesn't look a day older. We had a great talk. All the world is agog at present because Germany \"in the cause of humanity\" is offering Peace Terms. The Allies so far show no compliance but nothing of course is settled or even begun. The truth to me seems as though she were sick of it, so long as she was winning she didn't think much of the \"cause of humanity\", nor is she doing so now with her deportations and her outrages on every side, but the papers are extremely interesting and one watches it all with deep concern. <br/>\n        We are slowly but surely beginning to feel the pinch of the War. Living is becoming very complicated for many many mouths - no meat has been obtainable except beef and mutton, its price now stands at 1/2 and 1/3 respectively - that is down here. All provisions are up and in London eggs are 6d each! After the New Year no more white flour will be used and standard bread will be the order of the day. Today there is a rumour in the paper that sugar rations are coming and of course we heard that meatless days are to be enforced, that will not affect us for we've done it for months. The railway companies are making great changes. All fares are to be 50% dearer, no luggage but what you carry is taken free, fewer expresses are to be run and the speed of those remaining limited and so on. I can get no figs this year, no Elvas Plums or Carlsbad of course, raisins and sultanas are so high that we use chopped dates for cakes and pudding and find them an excellent substitute. Butter we never have but Blue Band Margarine always and its awfully good, really excellent. Well, its a doubtful blessing living in these awful times, and often times one gets very weary of it all. Everyday and all the day however \"my knees are bent\" in thankfulness for our personal good fortune in those we love best. </p>\n<p><br/>\n<span><em>(Wynne's daughter Ysobel remembered this winter well. She writes: </em>\"The first winter in Somerset was bleak in more ways than one. The house was freezing, full of draughts - I suspect walls too thin, it was pseudo Tudor and only recently built. The grounds were a large piece fenced off as a garden, a field and a vegetable garden at the end of the field. This had been let to a farmer so no vegetables for us! and for some reason or other we couldn't buy any. Davis the gardener used to pinch swedes and cow cabbages for us and we ate hop tops and nettles. Also there was rationing and we couldn't get taken on by any shop so no butter, very little flour and sugar and we were hungry all the time. We used to bicycle round the country hunting for golden syrup and cheese.\"<em> In fact Ysobel is conflating the years, because rationing did not start officially until 1917, but as you can see above, it was still very difficult obtaining things and the family happily did without butter!) </em></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0      </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_7": {"order": 7, "title": "Viewer 7", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1916/december/Fallowfield_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<span><em><strong>This is another typically brief note - a Christmas Greeting from one of Wynne's many Fallowfield cousins - this one Walter, serving in the Navy.

I have never endured worse, the whole earth has been frost bound for days, white glistening hoar frost and thick fogs all day, all day long we have crept about black with cold. Bathing in such weather is torture, also getting out of bed in the mornings, and its really been too strenuous but this day and since its been much warmer and we've had a lot of snow.

We also set up the Tree and shall start decorating it tomorrow. Its all so jolly being together - \"jolly\" - well that's hardly the word to use these days but when one can cast the burden of the war off one's back its a very great blessing and an enormous help having all one's dear things round one. My man coming home is splendid and such a help, it seems quite odd not having to do everything oneself. and such a rest.

I have much writing of sorts to do and I have this excellent opportunity in which to do it. Having seen all members safely to bed I have creepingly returned to my sitting room, my sitting room indeed - it is mine no longer in the sense of a sanctum or haven of peace but simply a public sitting room where the household congregates!! Well, Xmas is over with, its stockings and tree, and my dear man has once more returned to duty. He had a full week and did not go back till Thursday. The days flew by all too soon and every day was full of jobs. We lopped the front trees, put up the hen house and the garden frame, three things I never should have got done without him, also got all the wood chopped that Mr Love gave me. On the afternoon of the 24th we decorated the Tree, H and Mother and I. During our move the packers lost our box of decorations, some of which I had had since old Brookfield days, but kind Mother bought me a whole new set and it looked lovely. That night we filled the stockings, how many many times has this been done before!? and at 6.15 the next morning all four children came trooping in to empty their contents upon our beds, the reason of such a very early visit being that we were going to Early Celebration. H cowered beneath the bed clothes utterly refusing to be made excited over anything at such an hour! Higher and higher grew the papers and contents and as the clamour became louder he only disappeared further from sight until at last he arose and scattered children, stockings, paper etc in all directions! To Church at 11.0 the whole family went, a very well conducted service taken by Mrs Lowes' son and son-in-law but while this war lasts how can one sing with our hearts the old hymns of Peace and Goodwill. <br/>\n        After lunch we got all the presents ready and arranged the schoolroom having tea at 4.0.

Dear things, it is a joy to live in their joy, one can at any rate forget for the moment one's burden of the present time. \"The present time\" - will one in years to come ever forget having lived through it? As I write this during the last few hours of this hideous year and look back on all its strife and sorrow I cannot find it in my heart to regret the passing of one single day. I would not have one hour back. God has been so very good to me and mine during the whole of this fearful time that I feel most deeply our tremendous cause for thankfulness but the sorrows of one's friends and ones losses outside one's family cannot help but sadden one on looking back through the weariness of it all. Please God 1917 will see better times - the War cannot go on for ever, it must end in time. <br/>\n        I have greatly neglected my diary of late, and such a thing hasn't happened to me for years but somehow the troublous times have taken the heart out of one. It has utterly destroyed the \"even tenor of one's way\". I am going to make an effort to be more regular in my next but I doubt of success. Daily happenings these days seem too utterly trivial to set down and yet one cannot write perpetually of War and nothing but War.

That day we learnt of the sinking of HMS Formidable, and this year we hear that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Persia_(1900)\">SS P.O.Persia</a> has been sunk and most of the lives lost. The telegram gave no details as to how, where or when, just the bald statement, and Oh! what a hideous shock it has given one. One lives in awful times and the weather is suitable as a most fearful gale is raging and has been for 3 days. I was at the Hut this afternoon - bus both ways, quite impossible to cycle. My man who has been in the Ypres Salient for the past six weeks writes that it is thought most probably another attack is to be made upon them, another gas attack I mean, but they have to await a S.E.Wind before it is possible. He writes of a possible Relief - I do trust and pray it may come off, I am so longing for his presence again. Great changes in the Commands out there are taking place, and recently Sir D Haig has gone to relieve Sir J French who is now at home in command of the Home Forces and has been made a Viscount. I hear Sir H Rawlinson has been given the 4th Army - how sweet for it! I must to bed now, it is weary that I am, all the others have been in theirs since long and the house is still and quiet. </p>\n<p><em><strong>January 2nd</strong></em><br/>\n        Eve's birthday <span><em>(Wynne's sister)</em></span>. Bless her, we were so glad to hear this mail that the wire we sent them arrived the morning after the letter in which we first told them that we had decided to have Win's operation performed. So they only had one night to think about it all, such a blessing. <span><em>(A good example of communication in those days - they decided on the operation towards the end of November so the letter must have taken around a month).</em></span><br/>\n        This day began by being still, warm and dry and a thrush sat on the oak tree and gave me a long spring song before breakfast, it was very beautiful to listen to. By 10.0 our usual rain appeared and it poured and pelted to such an extent that I couldn't take the children to Kirk. This has been Intercession Sunday with special services for those who are bearing our burden at the various Fronts, how full our heart feels as all those many thousands come into our mind, poor brave ones. What horrible conditions many are living in, it almost makes one hate the comforts which are still our daily portion. I took the children to evening service at St Marks, a pitch black night but with the spasmodic aid of Pinkie's new torch we found our way. The church was very full and we had a nice bright little service. <br/>\n        No letter from H today, but I am rejoiced to see that in the Despatches on Saturday his name was again mentioned. Such a horrible disaster was published in Sat. evening's paper: SS Persia, one of the big liners, has been torpedoed off Crete and nearly all hands appear to have been lost. She was to have reached Port Said that day, I long for further news and details. </p>\n<p><em><strong>January 3rd</strong></em><br/>\n        Although just to make us feel at home I suppose it did rain a trifle today, yet on the whole it was most lovely, warm and sunny and still and a thrush sat in the oak tree singing away like they do in April. The children played about in the garden all day long and I went out and poked around, all the bulbs are shooting out of the earth, great masses of them. A letter from H today telling me the delightful news that he has been given the billet of Corps Artillery Commander and so will have 3 Divisions to look after instead of one. I am so awfully glad though of course I fancy it will retard his leave somewhat, but its worth it. I bicycled in to the Hut today and my goodness, the road - at most places they are simply not fit to use so I had to walk most of the day. </p>\n<p><em><strong>January 4th</strong></em><br/>\n        A day of darkness and rain. I spent most of it trying to write letters but interruptions were everlasting and Oh! I do long to go and hide sometimes. The world is too much with one on these occasions. I've just come back from the Heath End Hut - there was not enough to do at that little show and its very wearying and tiring. We never get more than 30 or 40 men and one could manage them alone quite well. I got three letters from H today, nothing further as to his movements. </p>\n<p><strong><em>J</em></strong><em><strong>anuary 5th, Wednesday</strong></em><br/>\n        The whole day in Town at the Panto and most awfully good it was.

I had not got far before I realized that I couldn't use the road at all, I've never seen anything like the condition, enormous crater-like holes filled with water and a foot of slimy mud all over them, so I just rode on the footpath. On my way back Win overtook me and so I got a lift up, bicycle and all. The driver then told me that next week as a raid is expected all headlights are to be forbidden and only two small oil lamps will be allowed so no cars will come into the country at all, what is to be done I don't know. How to carry on about my Hut work. I can't walk home all alone and bicycling on these roads is out of the question. I do hope I shall not have to give it up but it looks precious like it for the present. <br/>\n        I had a letter from William Gilham today, from what he says I gather the boy must be in Serbia, he describes the bitter cold and the huge mountains.

Next week most stringent lighting restrictions are coming out and all the taxis say they will not run. What I am to do when the weather is too bad for cycling I don't know.

I met a Red Cap who sympathized with me and said he didn't blame me! A very busy afternoon, no cessation to the steady stream of men. I got home about 6.0 and played games with the children. Mr Burgess came to supper and played most beautifully. </p>\n<p><em><strong>January 9th</strong></em><br/>\n        After two days blank I got 3 letters from H this morning telling me the delightful news that he is coming home on leave on Tuesday, he will have been away for 6 whole months.

Lovely weather to begin with and I started forth at 9.30 to catch the 10.0 train, the last thing I saw being Nootie vigorously pumping Peter's paw up and down in farewell to me. <span><em>(Peter was Ysobel's toy rabbit - see <a href=\"http://www.wynnesdiary.com/1915_pages/july/viewer_1.html\">his wedding story</a> in 1915!)</em></span> I got to Town and Mother's flat at 11.30 to find her just gone out with Aim and so I went to buy me a new hat! then back to lunch where I found my dear B.G. and with whom we had a great cackle. At 2.30 I left and went to Douglas for my hair wash and then to Victoria - as the time drew nearer my heart thumped louder and louder. Thinking the train arrived at 4.30 I went to the platform at that hour to find it didn't do so till 4.55 so as I was much too restless to stay on the platform I went and had some tea but I gulped it down in about 5 minutes as I was again far too restless to stay there! so back I went to the platform. <br/>\n        How can I describe this most curious scene. The platform was in semi-darkness and many people were walking up and down there to meet their beloved ones, upon their faces were expressions of contentment and suppressed excitement. I got up on to a bench in company with many others in order to be above the crowd. Behind us was the huge station clock - how those hands dragged, it seemed as if they never moved. At length there was a whisper that she was coming and round the bend in the line I saw two great eyes gliding along, one green, one white, and immediately there was a sort of hush on the platform as she crept in, coming at last to a panting standstill as all the doors burst open and hundreds came pouring out. At once all was wild confusion and as one after the other on our bench spotted their own they dropped off like leaves from a tree and darted towards the object of their search. I eagerly scanned each face as it hurried by but no Poggy did I see, and as the place cleared a bit I realized he hadn't come. Questioning the Guard in anxious tones he reassured me by saying that as more crossed last night there were 2400 to come this night and that the trains would come in every 20 minutes! so I waited another half hour of feverish expectancy and at length amongst the crowd of the next one I found the face I looked for, and all else was forgotten. We took taxi and drove to the Flat, passing the evening in talking and contentment but never shall I forget that scene, the dim light and the crowded platform, upon one side of which long tables were set with tea, buns, sandwiches and cakes by some Charitable Society and upon which the famished men fell to break their fast before each melted away to some joyously awaiting home, and what a strange sight they were in their motley clothes, all covered with mud straight from the trenches, mud on boots, accoutrements, rifle, face and clothes! Poor chaps - there were some people on my bench come to meet their Tommy who had arranged to whistle. This they did over and over again and at last in the far distance I heard the answer coming, nearer and nearer, till at last they met. Such joy is almost too sacred to look upon. </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_7": {"order": 7, "title": "Viewer 7", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1916/january/ASCards_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<span><em><strong>Three examples from the Active Service series - Wynne has 5 of these stuck into January too...</strong></em></span><br/>\n<span><em>The titles are, in descending order: Rifle Brigade within a short distance of the German trenches;  Our Indian Troops in France on their way to battle; and A Happy Card party at the Front. \n          </em></span><br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"460\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"617\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1916/january/ASCards2.jpg\" width=\"460\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"443\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"288\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1916/january/ASCards1.jpg\" width=\"443\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_8": {"order": 8, "title": "Viewer 8", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n<p><em>January 16th - 19th</em></p>\n<p>News from India, \"Spring Pies\", and Herbert's leave ends.\n            The Diary breaks off until March </p>\n\n\n", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<span><strong></strong></span></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>January 16th, Sunday</strong></em><br/>\n        I have had no time for writing this week, with a man on leave one does not idle away the precious hour by too much writing.

H and I walked into Aldershot and took bus home. We heard this morning from Mother that she had heard by cable that Ell had reached Suez by which we know that he has gone to Mesopotamia and not stayed in Egypt.

I then went and took Win's passage, its actually come as near as that, but oh! I cant think she will really go unless conditions change considerably in the meantime. Poggy is home for the weekend, its glorious seeing him home again. </p>\n<p><em><strong>June 3rd</strong></em><br/>\n        On opening the paper this morning we were aghast at reading of a frightful battle at sea. The German fleet it appears came out of its hiding hole and met our Destroyers and Cruisers and a fearful fight took place. Very few details are to hand as yet but it is known to have been the biggest sea engagement that has ever taken place and thousands of lives have been lost including I see Sir Robert Arbuthnot so poor Dally is now Sir Dalrymple. </p>\n<p><em><strong>June 4th</strong></em><br/>\n        We have got hold of a Sunday Times with a few further details. The engagement took place on 31st May and night of the 1st June. Words cannot describe the horror of it all but I have put in here some cuttings relating to it . Only 3 men so far as I can hear are gone from this place, one of the girls' husbands being one only married 3 months. </p>\n<p><em><strong>June 5th</strong></em><br/>\n        This is our wedding day. 15 years of an ideal existence. I wish, I wish I could have it all over again. It is ripping having my man home for it but he left this morning. I drove him to the station in Stella's pony cart and got caught in a big storm of rain. The paper has more details today and gradually its coming to light that what looked like a pretty bad knock has really been almost the other way, our losses have been frightfully heavy but those of the Germans' as much so and they have lost appalling numbers. </p>\n<p><em><strong>June 6th</strong></em><br/>\n      The weather suits the depression of the present time - cold, grey and wet. Most fearful happenings are taking place on every Front. Verdun still continues in increased fury, the Germans using every possible effort; poor old Ypres is again the scene of horrible fighting and the Canadians which hold that line have taken a knock; the Russians have a huge move on and claim to have taken 13,000 prisoners; on the other hand the Austrians are driving the Italians back badly but the climax for us was reached by hearing tonight that Lord Kitchener and all his staff have gone down in HMS Hampshire off the Orkneys. He was on his way to Russia.

I failed to write it and therefore cannot remember anything about it. This day though I started forth on a strange quest all on my own, viz. that of house hunting for we have decided to leave this lovely spot at Michaelmas if I can find a suitable home and this is what I am out to do. I am at Exeter, a lovely and fascinating town though I expect to be too busy to see much of it. I am here at the Clarence Hotel, an old Coaching Inn, most comfortable and clean and have a room in the top storey for 5/-. </p>\n<p><em><strong>June 14th</strong></em><br/>\n  A busy day is behind me. I sallied forth directly after breakfast to see an agent with the result that during the day I managed to view 4 houses in the morning at Whimple to which I went by train and found neither <span><em>(sic)</em></span> at all satisfactory and after lunch I bicycled away out to Chudleigh where I saw two more, one was a grim little old house which had been a grammar school, quite impossible, and the other a more modern affair with convenient interior but of hideous appearance, so that was off, and I went home by train. The ride there was absolutely lovely and I am amazed at the beauty of this country, miles of rich deep pasturage through which the red cattle wander knee deep, high wooded hills and long valleys and most picturesque houses. </p>\n<p><em><strong>June 15th</strong></em><br/>\n      My birthday and I am 37 today - perish the thought! Letters from the dear man and kinder but I quite forgot at first that it was my birthday. Again to the Agents and cycled out to Cullompton all along the Exe Valley past Pinhoe (scenes of my early childhood) until at last after about 12 miles I found the village. There I saw another house, Bolealler by name - hideous - standing in very pretty grounds and buried in the heart of the country. I rested half way and went into a wood where I ate my lunch and then proceeded. It is frightfully hot, quite perfect weather and no wind, absolutely ideal for cycling and so different from home where it is always raining these days. But none of these houses are any use so I go on to Yeovil tomorrow. </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1916/june/WaronLand_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<span><em><strong>A report of the War on the Land, with special mention of the Canadian action at Ypres. <br/>\n</strong></em></span></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"450\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"1419\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1916/june/WaronLand.jpg\" width=\"450\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><span><em><strong> </strong></em></span></p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_6": {"order": 6, "title": "Viewer 6", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n<p><em>June 16th - 19th</em></p>\n<p>More house hunting.

I rode out and at the end of 12 miles at length came upon a lovely village. The property is all Lord Poulett's and I saw two houses there, one no use, the other seems just what we want but it is not very pretty but has a lovely garden. A dear old woman caretaker showed me round and then I wandered round the village and inspected the Church which is charming, indeed I am most struck with it all, there is hardly an ugly house in the place and the surrounding country is perfect - but I yet have one or two more to see. </p>\n<p><em><strong>June 17th</strong></em><br/>\n        I have had such a journeying today. I first went by train to Axminster and rode from there 2 miles to see another house, a castellated dwelling of vile appearance with a pretty garden in vile order. Such a nice young woman showed me round and insisted on taking me back to her cottage and gave me tea, I find the people round here are extraordinarily courteous. I next rode down to Seaton on the coast but was very disillusioned, it is a pokey new little place and no sand, it lies between Beer and Lyme and I don't want to see it again. At 5.0 I took train and after a journey of 3 hours pottering arrived home and very glad to be there but though I am not finding suitable houses I am enjoying myself immensely. </p>\n<p><em><strong>June 18th</strong></em><br/>\n        I realized yesterday that I was only 6 miles from my Win and so accordingly I rode over to lunch at Sherborne. I went and fetched her at 2.0. We went off to the Digby where we sat in the garden till tea time which we had at the Hotel and then went back to the school where we attended Evening Chapel and listened to an admirable address by Miss Faithfull of Cheltenham College. After that I had supper with the girls and at 8.45 rode home in the cool of the evening, it has been a hot day though and the road is one long switchback, such awful hills I nearly died over one of about 2 miles long. Win dear one, is looking splendid, no eczema and as Head Girl of her house is thoroughly enjoying herself. I can't realize that it is her last term.<br/>\n<span><em>(The Digby was then a hotel.

I went to see a house at a remote spot called Upton. I took train to Morebath, a wee station on the Barnstaple line. When I alighted no one else did and the train went lumbering on its way. I then enquired of the Station Master and a youthful porter the way to Upton. They vaguely waved their arms and said they couldn't direct me but would ask Mr ..., a countryman who happened luckily to be there. He too waved his arms and when I realized that my road in that boiling heat lay over a mountain my heart sank. However, Excelsior I thought and started forth. The road was a mere track covered in ruts and huge stones and grew steeper and steeper until when I had reached an angle like that of a fly on the wall I paused, mopped my fevered brow and one by one removed my gloves, my silk coat and my woven knickers and strapped them all on behind. Still the road climbed up and up and still the sun beat down, and not a creature hove in sight to ask the way of, but at long last I arrived at the village of Upton and there found a very polite young woman who led me to the house one and a half miles further on, there I found a nice house in a wood far remote from any human habitation with a lovely view and large grounds but oh! not for us and after a look round I cycled to Wiveliscombe 12 miles distant through the most lovely country, the high hedges covered with roses and honeysuckle and ferns, such hills like precipices and at 10.30 I at last got home to bed, a wild goose chase indeed! </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_7": {"order": 7, "title": "Viewer 7", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1916/june/Postcard2_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<span><em><strong>Two interesting propaganda postcards from France.

They want \u00a3150 a year but I told her that was impossible so she is going to talk it over with her husband and phone me in the morning. She told me moreover that both the late occupants of St George's House have cancer and that it is very damp and unhealthy, that was quite enough. Even if we cant get this one I shouldn't dream of living there.

H had not been there for 40 years! so he saw some changes! and we found Mr Eustace the Tutor who took us up to Pink's room and through the Lynedock Dorm where H was as a boy. We also called on the Master and then walked round the lakes. Whilst there the rain descended in a flood and we had to fly back to the Hotel where we had tea and then returned by the 6.0 train.

I haven't done that for years but this time it was not voluntary, and this is the explanation of it all. Before H came home my right armpit began to feel sore and as it was the place I had had X-Rayed 3 years ago I sent for Hussey. <span><em>(See May 13th 1913)</em></span>. For a week I played around with ointment and unguents to no avail and so the day my man left, Friday Jan 21st I went on Dr H's advice to see a specialist in Town, Dr Sequira, who gazed at it, asked a few questions and ordered me to bed. Little did I know that it would be 5 or 6 weeks before I got up again. Well after a fortnight as it wouldn't get better the Drs here sent me to Town again to see another man, Sir Watson Cheyne. He ordered an operation, so on Feb 10th each armed with their black bags and various bogey tricks they worked their wicked wills upon me. I will not dwell upon the time that followed, it was one of horrible pain followed by much discomfort and now I am still hors de combat but come down stairs in my n\u00e9glig\u00e9!<br/>\n<span><em>(A Dr Sequira was a witness at one of the Ripper inquests in 1888 - can it be the same man? Watson Cheyne was a very famous surgeon at the time, and became embroiled in a controversy regarding the relatively new art/science of chiropractic which had been taken up by the army before the war. Extraordinary though it may sound to us, Wynne had had her armpits bombarded with X-rays in 1913 as a cure for excessive sweating. Given the paucity of knowledge then about these things, this was regarded as a miracle cure, but clearly what happened was a cancer formed. They cut out the damaged skin in an operation performed at her home - hence the reference to black bags etc).</em></span><br/>\n        I did my hair up for the first time so am beginning to feel less bogeyish and Dr H says we may start off for Town in about a week's time. Meanwhile I have other more interesting news to relate, some 10 days ago I had a letter from my man to say many of the higher commands are being filled by younger men and he is coming home. Since which I've had no further news of his coming, each day I get more impatient and always expect a wire. I don't think they can keep him much longer now and I think its rather rotten their doing so at all after telling him that he is to come. One day, the 9th Feb., Capt. Gore Browne came to see me, he was on leave, and it was a refreshment, so cheery and nice and said such nice things about my man, it made me feel quite chokey and all through these past few weeks one has been glad of all the cheer one can have. But everyone is and has been very kind, Stella and Joane Bacon come in almost every day and I am kept supplied with fruit and flowers and literature. I also get visits from Mrs Newcombe, Mrs de Mornay and Skippy who has been home on leave but who alas left yesterday. I read and read and read. I've got through 3 volumes of Motley Dutch Republic for the second time! <span><em>(this refers to \"The Rise of the Dutch Republic\" by John Lothrop Motley, a Victorian author who died in 1877. It was published in 1856),</em></span> the Letters and Memoirs of de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 and Saint Simon, Social France in the 17th Century besides some novels and the daily paper which at present is full of thrills and excitement. The Germans are making an enormous push round Verdun and so far though they have forced the French to retire a bit yet the latter are making a great stand and the paper says that we've had no bigger battle since the beginning of the war. How anxious are the times. <br/>\n        Later: since writing above I have had a wire from H saying he is to arrive in London tomorrow. Alas! would that I could meet him. He will stay the night with Mother, go and report at the War Office on Friday and then I hope return to the bosom of his family. What a blessed peace it will be for us to have him here and I hope he'll be with us for some little time. <br/>\n        Two horrible disasters at sea have just taken place: the P&amp;O's largest liner, the <a href=\"http://www.ssmaloja.co.uk\">Maloja</a>, sunk by a mine near Dover, 155 lives lost, and the French transport in the Med, over 900 lives lost - awful. <br/>\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>March 2nd, Thursday</strong></em>. <br/>\n        Another wire from H today saying he has arrived in Town and is coming down by the 11.45 tomorrow. My arm is so much better that I'm hoping to be able to go to Town on Tuesday where we shall all be with Mother for a month of five weeks. I am much looking forward to a real change. Mr and Mrs de Mornay came to tea today followed by my faithful crony Joane Bacon. She had just been milking. Fearful battles are raging round <a href=\"http://www.wereldoorlog1418.nl/battleverdun/index.htm\">Verdun</a>. One of the outer forts, that of Douaumont, has been captured by the Germans but they are now surrounded, it is the largest engagement since the War and fearful loss of life on both sides but the French are making a valiant stand and one holds ones breath as to the issue.</p>\n<p><em><strong>March 3rd</strong></em><br/>\n        At 1.30 my man returned today having reported at the W.O. in the morning and stayed the night with Mother. It is so awfully nice to have him back and feels much nicer than I have words to say! I have heard today that our Ell is attached to the 33rd Light Cavalry and is in Mesopotamia with the Euphrates force under General Brooking. So far so good and I hope we soon get a letter. </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_3": {"order": 3, "title": "Viewer 3", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1916/march/GermanTrench_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<span><em><strong>A picture postcard of German trenches, sent by Herbert to his youngest daughter Eleanore.

The Dean of Manchester preached and we had such a beautiful anthem with mens and boys voices all of the best. Then after lunch we went and heard delightful music at the Queens Hall which I enjoyed immensely.

They are creating a great furore and are certainly clever but many are most horrible and haunting, no Englishman would have a vivid enough mind to draw such things, it is a regular Wirtz gallery. At 4.0 we went to meet Mrs Brecks at the Club who came to have tea with us.

The Queen and her ladies were there and if I had been her I should have broken down, I know it was simply lovely. Albert Sammons played the violin and 2 men sang.

I went then with her to the W.O. buildings where she works and saw all over the busy beehive and at 1.0 we lunched at Stuarts. Then I fled home and immediately again rushed forth with Mother and H to the Palace Theatre where a huge meeting was held in aid of the building fund for the Star and Garter Home for totally disabled sailors and soldiers. it was a most interesting show. Lord Charles Beresford, Ben Tillett, Lady Betty Balfour, Miss Compton and others spoke each in their own way most excellently. The women of England have undertaken to collect \u00a350,000 for the rebuilding of the old Star and Garter at Richmond to make a permanent home for the totally disabled, and i hope they'll raise it quickly. The thought of these helpless men with a future many of them of years of hopelessness in front of them makes one feel one cannot do enough. <br/>\n<span><em>(Betty Balfour was a Lytton - one sister, Constance, was a notable suffragette. Betty was not militant, but did support the movement. Lord Charles Beresford was a sort of caricature John Bull figure, wheeled out for these events. He was an Admiral and an MP, with a reputation as a ladies man - the Empress of Austria and the Duchess of Warwick being amongst his trophies. The Home was funded principally by the women of the Empire, who made it their lasting War Memorial).</em></span></p>\n<p><em><strong>March 25th</strong></em><br/>\n        To the Stores shopping in the morning, to lunch at the Breeks, and I to tea with Mrs Parsons. She has a little house near here and is hard at work at munitions every day. </p>\n<p><strong>March 26th, Sunday</strong> <br/>\n        To St Mary Abbots in the morning with the family and after lunch to a delightful concert again at the Queens Hall. Wagner began it and a good deal of Tchaikovsky followed played by a man called Benno Moiseiwitsch, an expert quite and much applauded and it ended by \"1812\". The Concert began by the Russian national anthem, it is a most beautiful air. The organ accompanied today and all stood up and the same impressive scene occurred at the end for ours, which everyone sang<br/>\n<span><em>(Benno Moiseiwitsch, 1890 - 1963, was originally from the Ukraine and came to London in 1909. He became a British citizen in 1937, and was awarded the CBE in 1946 for his work during the Second World War. He specialised in the Romantic repertoire.)</em></span></p>\n<p><em>March 27th</em><br/>\n        Fearing for sometime past that there was something wrong with Noots' eyes I took her off to the occulist and was very much relieved to find that they were quite sound, but she pokes over her books so we thought she was short-sighted. After lunch H and I set forth to Chislehurst to see Brenda and her crew. Jacky has been horribly ill but is better, the two smaller ones are sweet and look splendid. </p>\n<p><em><strong>March 28th</strong></em><br/>\n        We saw a fine thing today, a big cinema show at Drury Lane called \"The Birth of a Nation\", viz. the American War. It was awfully well done, horribly pathetic and emotional but so interesting. The kind Duke lent us his box. H's orders came tonight, the 67th Division at Sevenoaks.</p>\n<p><em><strong>March 29th</strong></em><br/>\n        Off to the dentist this morning, thank goodness I've fixed up for a while now again. After lunch Mother took us to see \"Please Help Emily\" at the Playhouse - Charles Hawtrey, Gladys Cooper and Lottie Venne - so amusing and clever and it was a real treat seeing a theatre again. </p>\n<p><em><strong>March 30th</strong></em><br/>\n        I've been out all day, first for shopping, then to lunch with the dear Todds after which to Douglas to have my hair washed and then to tea with Muriel Kayvell. </p>\n<p><em><strong>March 31st, Friday</strong></em><br/>\n      I and the two children have been at the Zoo all day long, my man was to have come too but he has an attack of shingles and so is keeping the house. It is most unfortunate for him coming now as of course he cannot join but I am only too thankful to keep him a little longer. Well we started forth at 10.30 taking sandwiches with us which at 1.0 we devoured with some drinks which we bought. We did the thing most thoroughly, and got hold of several keepers who took us behind the scenes and showed us various unseen animals which is always so interesting. The children also rode on elephants and camels and drove in the lama cart and we didn't get back till 6.30. </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}}, "errors": [], "description": "\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n<p><span>Wynne has been keeping her diaries since 1895. \n\n  She was ill in February, and wrote nothing - the diary resumes in March with an account of her illness. </span></p>\n\n"}, "may": {"viewers": {"viewer_1": {"order": 1, "title": "Viewer 1", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1916/may/DublinRising_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong><br/>\n<em>The Dublin Rising of . </em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"490\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"326\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1916/may/DublinPix.jpg\" width=\"490\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"248\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"545\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1916/may/DublinRising.jpg\" width=\"248\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_2": {"order": 2, "title": "Viewer 2", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n<p><em>May 1st - 5th</em></p>\n<p>The Irish Uprising in Dublin but secondary education for the children is uppermost in Wynne's mind. </p>\n\n", "description": "<td>\n<p><br/>\n<span><strong></strong></span></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>May 1st, Monday</strong></em><br/>\n        Alas! the weather has changed and we have a typical May day, rather cold and grey. The papers are full of the Irish Rising and Easter Monday seems to have been the beginning. How awful it all is and all backed by Germany who has caught hold of the Sinn Feiners and duped them into expecting an armed force to come to their aid. Bloodshed and murder, wholesale looting and burning, and the whole of Dublin in an uproar. No communication with the country as they took possession of the Post Office and cut all the wires but each day the papers are able to tell a little more and troops are being poured in.</p>\n<p><em><strong>May 2nd</strong></em><br/>\n        Here is a picture of what Dublin looks like, the \"Rebellion\" is practically at an end, the Rebel leaders have been caught and many rebels shipped over to England.

She has been made Head of her House and Games Captain of the School, though a year younger than is usual and we are very proud of her, and I can't realize that this is her very last term. <span><em>(Win was at Sherborne. Meanwhile Wynne's son was about to start at Wellington).</em></span></p>\n<p><em><strong>May 4th </strong></em><br/>\n        I saw Win off at 10.24 and on this day my son began his public school career. We went by the 3.10 and on arrival were informed that as there was no vacancy in the Combermere he had been placed in the Lynedock - Herbert's old dorm. As this was quite by chance it seemed a good omen and I was so awfully pleased. We went at once to his Tutor who with his wife gave us a very pleasant welcome and tea, both young people and her Father was tutor of Lynedock in H's time, Airey by name. He then showed us the dormitory and Pink's room as for this term there is no vacancy and Pink and 3 others are living with the Tutor which is rather nice. We then betook ourselves to see the Master. We entered his mystic portals with faltering steps, and sat awaiting his awe-inspiring presence. When he arrived I humbly presented my little microbe and we both sat up on our hind legs, a pleasant and friendly man and Pinkie afterwards decided that he wasn't so bad as he expected! We then went off to the tailor to get his cap and ribbon which act made him a member of the School. Pink came to see me off and out of the train came young Lewis who had been at Southlea so they were able to trot back together. Dear Son, good luck go with you, its horrid being a Mother on these occasions. </p>\n<p><em><strong>May 5th</strong></em><br/>\n      I feel utterly bereft without my two school children. Maby came home this evening and so term and regularity begin once more. I think I hate the end of the holidays just as much as they do. We hear that 3 Rebel Leaders have been tried and shot, not much delay about that, but Roger Casement the beast still lives. I heard from my dear Ell yesterday dated March 29th - very hard work chiefly patrolling and very hard on the horses but he was well, thank God.

I was so very pleased today to see Algie, he is in the 67th Western Scottish C.E.F. over at Bordon and came to lunch and tea. I was much interested to hear all his experiences which are many and varied. I walked down to the station with him across the Park which is looking its very best, but oh, how I die to quit this neighbourhood with its country which is no country and its horrible Aldershot which is no Town. </p>\n<p><em><strong>May 8th, Monday</strong></em><br/>\n        I went to resume duty at the Hut today after an absence of about 3 and a half months it seemed so strange being there again and it was very empty, the 41st Division having left last week and none come in in its place. Mrs Doran was there and we had very little to do, how different from the old days when we were run off our feet, but I expect it will be busy again by the end of this week as several thousand are coming. I have heard from my blessed little son, he feels very strange and I fancy a bit lonely and I miss him most horribly but alas, it happen to us all and is the best thing for a boy. He'll soon settle down I expect and then of course he will love it all. </p>\n<p><em><strong>May 9th</strong></em><br/>\n        Oh! it is cold again, much rain all day and a general air of dankness around.

He is looking so very well, I don't think I have ever known him better and it is a joy to me.

We had a lovely afternoon taking our tea away up into the fields and gathering heaps of bluebells for the Flower Mission. I set off ahead on my bicycle and Maby and the children followed after lessons, it was perfect up there, the only sounds being the endless song of reed warblers, an occasional cuckoo or pigeon, the lazy hum of insects and the distant voice of a ploughman.

Our activities have been unbounded this afternoon for at 2.15 Mr Love came down and we all set to and mowed and rolled the lawn but could not quite finish it and the men of course were a sad interruption, poor fellows. I had 3 crutches here today and one with one arm, so sad to see all this maimed humanity and they are so grateful for anything one does.

I went first this morning to meet Pink at Charing Cross and took the young shaver home and he went in the afternoon to see a cinema with Ell.  I at 2.0 went to the Hall but unfortunately so great had been the demand for seats that we could only get two and those not even being together Poggy didn't come up, therefore I went alone.  Arriving in good time I found my stall and met around me many old friends, and gradually that vast place was filled from arena to gallery with one closely packed sea of faces.  Round the centre in the boxes sat 700 of the available survivors of the \"Mighty Little Force\" who had previously lunched with the Lord Mayor and processed in cars through the city, and in the Royal Box were the King and Queen and royal party.  At one end the huge organ was packed on either side by the men and women of the Bach choir whilst below Allen and his immense orchestra sat waiting.  When all was ready in absolute silence Allen raised his baton for the opening piece, a joyous intimation of what London was like before the War, followed by various items on the enclosed programme some of which were above the heads of the soldier audience, but I loved it all. About midway Mr Balfour read that most wonderful and appropriate chapter out of Ecclesiasticus in memory of the dead and then the Roll Call of every regiment in the Seven divisions was called by Lord Derby.  As each pathetic group of men heard its regiment called long cheers echoed up into the roof of that huge building, a great outburst greeted the mention of the R.A.M.C and loud ones of derision arose when the list was completed by the A.P.D!  <span><em>(A.P.D. = Army Pay Department)</em></span>.  The King then called for Three Cheers and the ceremony was over.  On leaving the Hall I met our dear old friend <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Walter_Sandilands\">General Sandilands</a>, it was like a bolt from the blue and we walked to a tea shop in the neighbourhood where we talked over old friends and old times and I heard all his news and a history of his wanderings since we last met in the days of Aldershot.  So ended a very wonderful experience. I am forgetting to mention the blaze of colours made by the regimental banners which were hung round the Hall which many of us women helped to make, and I shall always feels proud to think that the 12th Battery in which dear little Fatty Lee was, was the work of my blundering fingers. All our banners, the R.As, are going to be hung in the Garrison Church at Woolwich, a most fitting destination.  Also there were hung around the Hall huge laurel wreaths sent in memory of those who have gone west, and very pathetic it was to see one or two tiny ones amongst the larger tributes, all emblems of a great love and great sorrow.  The hymn \"For All the Saints\" was sung by the whole audience and it was most terribly upsetting.  One felt that the spirits of all our dear men were very close, and I am convinced that they are always with us. <br/>\n        This evening which was most cheering Ell took Pink and me to see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_Chin_Chow\">Chu Chin Chow</a> at His Majesty's, a wonderfully staged sort of pantomime. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1917/december/Banner_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>Alongside many women, Wynne worked one of the banners that were to hang at the Albert Hall for the commemoration of the exploits of the first 7 Divisions in 1914.

I've had such a frantically busy day that there's been no room for frills.  Of course its been the joy of my life having my Ell here as it must be quite 22 years since he spent an Xmas at home, but its all been rather more of a toil that a pleasure in consequence of Cathy's absence, so important is a cook's presence in the house!  We went to Church, all of us except Mother of course who cannot get, and Florrie managed the lunch very well.  Then we decorated the tree and carted in all the presents into the schoolroom, had tea and at 5.30 all trooped in and we had the usual distribution and all very gay.  The War certainly made no difference to the children I think they had more things than ever and thoroughly enjoyed  themselves.  Early this morning they came in with their stockings and emptied the contents on to our beds and all seemed very pleased.  It would all have been perfect in spite of things if I had been a free agent but there was too much anxiety on my mind to enjoy myself over much.  However nothing lasts for ever and in two days I fancy my responsibilities should cease. </p>\n<p><strong><em>December 26th</em></strong><br/>\n        We spent a good part of it laying the new brick edging in the garden but it was very cold and not very enjoyable.  I wish I could have Ell with us for weeks, he's awfully good on odd jobs and quite keen and its all so jolly working together. </p>\n<p><em><strong>December 27th</strong></em><br/>\n        Poggy went off today back to Norwich to hand over to Gen Nicholson and hopes to return on Sat.

Spent the whole afternoon with the two Elliots sifting the Ash Heap!  We put up a cinder screen and made a large heap of ashes in one place and another of cinders, another of rubbish which we burnt and then collected the pots and pans in large sacks and stuffed them down the rabbit holes! and so a good job is in progress for we shall use all the cinders for burning and the ashes for paths, besides which the pit is clearer and all labour voluntary!  But it is strange what ones fancy will lead one to do.  We'll be cleaning out the sewers next!</p>\n<p><em><strong>December 29th</strong></em><br/>\n        I am unfortunately in bed today alas.  Poggy returned tonight and when he dressed for dinner he doffed his uniform for the last time and I am quite sad. </p>\n<p><em><strong>December 30th</strong></em><br/>\n        Poggy took the kids to church and Mother, Ell and I were heathens.

At dinner we drank healths and thought of all those absent ones who we love and after dinner we four elders played Bridge whilst in the corner the children shrieked over other games.

Still there is always balm in Gilead for on Saturday \"The Loved One\" rang me up and asked me to go skating with him on a pond near Furlands Farm. Skating! the very word sounds magic to me - it is so long since I had the joy and we motored round there and plunged about till 4.0. I was awfully shaky and came a lovely cropper (so did he) and we planned to go to Chard on Sunday but alas the snow came down so thickly in the middle of the day that we had to give it up and I was awfully disappointed. Today, Monday, we all went to the Pond again which I and Davis brushed this morning but the snow had greatly spoilt it and it was awfully rough. However tomorrow with any luck we are going to Chard. Hurrah! I am longing for a good long stretch. And whilst I try to keep the cold out of my limbs by this simple and uncommon joy, the most untoward happenings are taking place, for Germany has declared universal submarine warfare against Allies and Neutrals combined, against armed and unarmed vessels and hospital ships included. It is the tactics of a wolf at bay, and is I verily believe her last stroke. And now in today's paper America has at last got upon her high horse and negotiations are broken off between them. Whether it means war one cannot tell but it looks precious like it. </p>\n<p><em><strong>February 6th</strong></em><br/>\n        The intense frost still holding up Mr Love rang me up last night and asked me to go skating with him today to Chard and so hiring a car as he feared his own might not get there we accordingly set forth at 2.0. It was a brilliant day, windless and sunny. On the way the car bucked twice but eventually we turned up to find an enormous sheet of what had been perfect ice, but Sunday snow lay thick upon it and we could only struggle round and round upon some alleys which a gang of sweepers had cleared. At 4.0 we felt we had had enough and so retired to the bank where we drank sloe gin and then walked into Chard to have some tea. The car meanwhile had gone to a garage to have its innards looked to and we had tea and waited for it. Well, hour after hour went by and still no car so Mr L went down to ascertain what was up and found that it refused to go at all so had to hire another and we eventually got back at 8.0 but it was lovely out: a brilliant moon and a complete absence of wind and if the ice had been possible I should not have wanted to come home even then. </p>\n<p><em><strong>February 7th</strong></em><br/>\n        My beloved Baby's birthday but she is a baby no longer for today she is 9 years old, the dearest and sweetest child, so good, so pretty and so absolutely perfect in my eyes. She is just like a perky little bird and has robin's eyes. We hid her presents in the dining room according to time honoured custom and the robin's eyes positively glistened with beady excitement. I had to be at Hospital all day at kitchen work but we had a big iced birthday cake and games afterwards.

In the Midlands on Sunday there were 38% of frost, on Monday 34 and on Tuesday the thermometer went to zero. It hasn't been as bad as that here but enough to apparently kill everything in the garden and the snow lies everywhere. Win and I went over and called on the Cheshires today and the Rawlins and found them both out. We had a lovely ride but the roads were awful, for all along they were covered with inches of frozen snow that was like hard mud in cakes and the going in consequence was very heavy. The papers are still all agog as to what is to happen with America. Neutrals have not followed the President's lead in breaking off negotiations with Germany and things still hang in the balance. The U Boat policy has started in earnest and every day we see \"13 ships sunk\", \"11 ships sunk\" and so on, and the wretched Neutrals have to put up with it. Three great questions are toward with us: the War Loan, the Rationing problem and the National Service. They are all voluntary so far but the Times says if the country does not take them up they will be forced to in each case, and really things are getting very serious. The Rations fixed for the country are 4lbs Bread per week, 2\u00bdlbs of meat and \u00belb sugar and I have calculated that we are very nearly with the limit all round. </p>\n<p><em><strong>February 12th</strong></em><br/>\n        Three more days of lovely skating and how we have enjoyed it but today there are signs of a thaw and I fear we shall get no more.

Today the paper tells of another large liner sunk, a B.I. boat going to India but all lives were saved except a few of the crew. The Times from today is to cost 2d with a further possible rise to 3d and perhaps 7d - it will have to be given up in that event and what shall we do. </p>\n<p><em><strong>February 13th, Tuesday</strong></em><br/>\n        I much enjoyed my prowl with Mrs Lowe today, a real country ramble. We started at 2.15 and the day was perfect, very bright sunshine and quite warm. She takes very small quick steps but walks about 1 mile an hour so our progress was slow but all the way she talked on and on in her endless and oddly breathless way telling me long interesting histories about all the neighbouring families, every detail of which she knew by heart.<br/>\n        We went to see several of the farmers' wives, such nice friendly folk, real old Yeoman stock, so well mannered. At one place, old Mrs Tozer's, Pink went with Dinnett on a mole catching expedition and they gave them lunch, refusing payment and Mrs Tozer told me she hoped he would come again. We returned in a leisurely way to tea and after tea being a lovely evening I didn't return home directly.. </p>\n<p><em><strong>February 14th</strong></em><br/>\n      This is my day at the Hospital. I work there every Wednesday in the kitchen and its one of the dirtiest jobs I know. The sink is out of order so one cannot use it at all and the only tap therefore (cold) is useless. All the water, hot and cold, has to be brought from the mens' bathroom miles away and all the dirty swill is thrown down a drain in the courtyard. Holsworth and I were alone today and had to provide for over 30 people. Its no loitering job but we got on splendidly, the cooking part I enjoy and I shouldn't mind the washing up if it were not for such a lack of water. Also Mrs Lowe provides nothing in the way of brushes, vim, mops or such like and so I take my own. I didn't get away till past 4.0 today as one has to leave everything tidy. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1917/february/POWpix_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"450\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"355\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1917/february/POWpix.jpg\" width=\"450\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><span><em><strong>The letter below, from Philip Lyster, a prisoner in Germany since Mons in 1914, was written in 1916.

The sun, the pale Spring sunlight that I love so much was streaming slantwise through the trees, casting flecky shadows eveyrwhere and glistening on the wet grey green trunks of beeches and the red rough stems of large firs. The larches shone bright gold against a very blue sky and all was very peaceful and remote.

He said he was so struck by it. </p>\n<p><em><strong>February 24th</strong></em><br/>\n        I have been much interested in some recent speeches in the House by LG and Carson. The former on National Economy and food, the latter on the Navy Estimates. Most wonderful they were and one felt on reading them that at last the country had men who would tell them the truth, but things are getting very acute indeed and I feel that compulsory rations will undoubtedly come into force before very long. Truly the times are evil. </p>\n<p><em><strong>February 26th, Monday</strong></em><br/>\n        Today we sowed the first peas in the open.

The last of February I spent a greater part in Hospital and there found both Holdsworth and Chadwick absent so had to manage with the Riddles cook, she was very capable and we got on splendidly but its pretty hard work for two. I afterwards refreshed myself by going to inspect Mr Love's garden and having tea with him.

I don't think I've ever felt the cold so much as I have this year, whether its the season or this house I don't know but its not for want of coal for I've had \u00a324 worth from Crewkerne and another \u00a313 from London and its really awful to see the way these grates eat it up.

I well remember seeing the first aeroplane flying over Hale - everyone rushed out to see it and I made a note of it in my Diary, it cannot be more than about 5 years ago. Of course if Lord M's words come true we shall go to India for the week end! but the ticket will probably cost about \u00a31000 each way!! We are still victims of intense cold. If only there was any place to skate how one would love it, but the nearest I believe is Chard. I took the girls for a walk this afternoon, we went through the Park. I had no idea it was so large and I'm longing to explore it in Spring, for even now it looks fascinating, but the great cold has made the country look just dead, not a leaf or blade of grass, even the brambles are withered up, and every branch lying on the ground has had all its bark gnawed off by the starving rabbits, poor wretches. All day long we find jobs of energy to try and keep ourselves from freezing and when I go to bed I dress up and this is what I wear: a pair of combies, a flannel nightdress, a bed jacket, bed socks, shawl round my waist and a hot bottle. I wish I had a dozen of the latter and tonight I shall don my dressing gown as well! </p>\n<p><em><strong>January 31st</strong></em><br/>\n        I have been working in the kitchen at the Hospital all today, of all walks of life I dont think I shall choose that of a kitchen maid, a filthier, more greasy, slimy occupation would be difficult to find and with no water arrangements its worse, but one puts ones hand to anything these days and no one thinks of complaining, it all for the men who put up with far worse for us. <br/>\n        We had four down to tea yesterday: Izard, Bolton, Grant and Coats, the latter poor man still goes on crutches and will never be much again. Bolton is marked out and goes tomorrow, Grant has a dropped wrist and I don't know why he isn't discharged because it can never be better, such a thing must be dreadfully depressing.

We drove up to my hotel, the Lyndale, where too are living all his officers and after lunch we started forth and walked to Leigh Woods of far fame!  It was very hot but so lovely in the woods which are of immense size extending all along the great spur of land on the Clifton side.

The singing is lovely but the acoustic properties of the building are so vile that we hardly hear at all and I wished afterwards we had gone to a smaller church.  After lunch we took tram to Westbury and walking from there to Coombe Dingle found ourselves in the heart of the country and sat down under a hedge discussing the earth and the heavens until it was time for tea which we had at a tiny cottage in company with many Bristolians who had also blown out that way.  A lovely day but so hot and after supper we trammed to the suspension bridge, took the hydraulic railway and walked along the Downs and so home. <span>(Wynne would have taken a tram to the base of the bridge, and then caught the now closed hydraulic railway that took her to the top by the Avon Gorge hotel).</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>July 23rd, Monday</strong></em><br/>\n      Alas all good things come to an end and today I sadly took my way home again.

Each day we went somewhere and saw people and I met a good many old friends amongst whom were the Malwells.  She has grown fat and plain and he bears a sort of haunted appearance and has several times been very near lunacy I believe poor chap.  Sir Bruce came to lunch one day - a very big bug in the soldier line and my host and my General both sat up on their hind legs and pawed the air to show their respect.  In the course of conversation I found that he had been as a boy in '72 at Woodcote - the company laughed much at such strange school fellows.  I returned home by the 8.20 from Norwich, had breakfast in the train and found confusion worse confounded at Liverpool Street.  No porters, no barrows, no taxis.  I had to get my own stuff out of the van and rush off for a taxi and getting to Waterloo the same thing happened.

I do not love our English climate from November to March but there are always lovely days or hours in every month.  It is again the season of full moon, consequently air raids almost every night.  I think it seems so odd how now we take these visitors as quite a matter of course, I can remember when not so long ago the first Zep came over and created a most tremendous fuss and ferment.  Nowadays we seldom have a Zep raid, it was found that so many came to grief it was too expensive a game and so they have substituted planes which do much more damage and nearly always get away owing to the far greater difficulty in hitting them, but last week or so having I suppose a few Zeps to spare a sort of job lot as it were! the Bosche sent them over on a dark night with the most disastrous results to themselves and very little damage to us for they were captured and shot and lost their bearings and their way, some finding themselves as far away as the Mediterranean, another giving itself up to an old munition worker in France armed with a shot gun! whilst another that came down had been too high and all its petrol was frozen and its occupants were frozen dead, one and all.  Most horrible. I don't fancy we'll see many more of that craft over here.  Early this week Parliament had a special sitting to pass a vote of thanks to all the men and women of the country for their heroism and endurance during the long time of stress and strain since 1914, and the Premier made the most perfect thing in the way of speeches I've ever read.  I was simply thrilled by it, a splendid simple flow of words and how proud it makes one feel to belong to England.  He laid special stress upon the valour of the fighting man, those countless thousands who have given up everything and life as well for the Cause, and then he gave an account of the marvellous records of Navy and Army in all branches.  It was fine and I wish every man and woman in the world could read it. </p>\n<p><strong><em>November 2nd</em></strong><br/>\n        All day long I've been working \"wrestling\" with \"endless chains\" of couch grass in the kitchen garden.

Old Lowey thoroughly enjoys herself on these occasions for she has the floor entirely to herself and her voice for one whole hour goes on in a ceaseless flow.  I flew back at 4.0 and went to the station to meet my Poggy who has come home for a few days leave.  He has till Wednesday and it is the very greatest joy to have him back again.  It is such a treat to me, I don't believe anyone can know how awfully I miss him all the time and how I never get used to being without him.</p>\n<p><strong>November 3rd</strong><br/>\n        A long days gardening with Poggy, a huge barrow load of couch the result.  Little by little it gets dug up but it still seems endless and one wonders if this dreadful garden will ever be quit of it.  Mr Love came to dinner and we played Bridge afterwards. </p>\n<p><strong><em>November 4th, Sunday</em></strong><br/>\n        I am spending the day in bed not feeling very burzling and so I've taken the opportunity of writing long letters to various neglected ones.

Day of days! Red Letter Day!  I was working hard this morning on the couch plot when Cathy brought in this telegram.  I could hardly believe my eyes and for a few minutes worked horribly at random!  I had not expected Ell for another fortnight at least and here he is safely landed in England. I packed up my goods and chattels, looked up a train and fled away to Town by the 4.28.  It was very full but I had quite a good journey and arrived not very late at Waterloo.  I had much difficulty in finding a porter and when I did he failed utterly to get me a taxi as they are nearly all on strike and those who weren't would not go as far as Kensington so the only thing was the Tube.  My box in one hand and my despatch case in another I therefore trudged along and by the time I reached the flat after many rests by the way I'd had about enough!  When I got to the door I rang and it was opened by Ell.  With his hand on the edge of the door he said \"you can't come in\".  I laid my hand on his and said \"If you don't let me in at once I shall burst into tears\" and in my intense excitement I felt like it.  What followed I cannot well remember, I only know that it is heaven to be with him again, to see him looking so well and so unchanged.  The seven week voyage has done him good and we three sat and talked till all hours but we have 2 years arrears to make up. </p>\n<p><strong><em>November 14th</em></strong><br/>\n        I sat indoors and took the opportunity of absence from home to write a lot of letters whilst Ell went out.  After lunch I went off shopping and had my tea there.  The place was crammed and one could hardly get attendance, all the decent men except the very old ones have gone and their places have been taken by impudent females of the usual counter class. Everywhere in the grocery dept are huge placards stuck up - \"No Tea Today\" \"No Sugar Today\".  Indeed to buy sugar over the counter is no longer possible, we are all on strict rations.  Mother has none in the house and uses honey for cooking and Saxine <span><em>(a trade name for saccharin)</em></span> for tea and coffee.  At tea I was waited upon by a very pretty girl who looked ill and tired.  I entered into conversation with her and gathered that she was very unhappy.  Her home was a sad one, her sister in consumption and her erstwhile man she had quarrelled with and he had disappeared so I got her name and address in order to send her some flowers.  How little sunshine some people have in their lives.  I then went home and after dinner we played Bridge. </p>\n<p><em><strong>November 15th, Thursday</strong></em><br/>\n        Ell and I lunched at Lady Fulton's today and afterwards went to a matinee of Ibsen's \"Ghosts\", a most interesting but truly horrible play on heredity with a tragic ending.  I was very glad to see it as i had never seen one of his before.  We had tea at the Bath afterwards. </p>\n<p><em><strong>November 16th</strong></em><br/>\n        Barkers first and then on to Oxford Street, ending up with tea at Stewarts in Piccadilly.  Came home on the top of a bus.  The evening was warm and still and all the shaded lamps and lights <span><em>(because of air raids)</em></span> down Piccadilly and Knightsbridge and across the Park looked like some huge stage scene, the big search lights on the top of Hyde Park gate reminded us of the reality of war and also made one feel safe as they never play on Raid nights. </p>\n<p><strong><em>November 17th</em></strong><br/>\n        Today Ell and I spent the whole day at Wellington with Pink.  Met the dear son at the Great Gate.  he came running out of school with an eager face and in spite of English reticence and many school boys I just hugged him up!  We then went up to his dorm and deposited various grub we had brought and went on to the Hotel to lunch after which back to College to call on Tutor and watch footer and then to tea and buy more grub and so came the end of a very happy day. Got home to find Poggy had come up for the weekend. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_7": {"order": 7, "title": "Viewer 7", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1917/november/Samson_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>This is the programme from the Royal Opera House for \"Samson and Delilah\"</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>This was an afternoon show.

(<em>In the evening</em>) there was a big fire in the coal yard behind the flats.  I've never seen such a thing, it blazed to the sky and hundreds of tons of coal were burnt. It lasted about 2 hours and was most exciting to watch. </p>\n<p><strong><em>November 19th </em></strong><br/>\n        My man went back today.  Went to meet a Mrs Henderson at my Club.  On December 15th there is to be a huge commemoration of the first Seven Divisions at the Albert Hall and each regiment and unit of all the Divs are giving a Banner which is to be hung in the Hall on the occasion.  The R.A. 7th Div have done me the honour of making me President of the Committee and so I went to meet Mrs H who is doing the organising and together we went to the School of Art Needlework to see our Banner.  It is in the regimental colours with a big golden gun in the centre surrounded by a scroll in red on which are embroidered in gold the different Brigades and Batteries.  Some of us have worked on it and I looked in fear and trepidation at my handiwork but was relieved to find that there were some which looked worse!  They are doing about 50 of them, it ought to be a very wonderful sight.  Tonight Ell and I went to a play called \"The Yellow Ticket\" about Russia and the horrors there.  Gladys Cooper, Allen Ainsworth and Sidney Valentin most excellent and I should like to see it again, it is a most dramatic affair but has a happy ending. Oh the treat it is to go to a play once more, to see the world for a few days and to get away from the petty and ridiculous smallness of life in the remote country! <em>(Note: The Yellow Ticket was based on a Frank Harris short story, and is about Tsarist Russia, and not about the current situation as might be implied here. The story is about a Jewish girl who can only earn money in order to study by getting a yellow ticket, which allows her to operate as a prostitute. Because of the anti-semitic laws then in place life for Jews was very difficult).</em></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>November 20th</em></strong><br/>\n        After lunch went to Lady Fulton's Bazaar at the Grosvenor Galleries.  There were hundreds of people and very mouldy things to buy, it was in aid of an institution for papier mach\u00e9 surgical aids. </p>\n<p><strong><em>November 21st, Wednesday</em></strong><br/>\n        Flew to the Pall Mall to have lunch, it is a busy little place of rendezvous this restaurant and so many soldiers seem to go there to meet friends, but indeed soldiers one meets everywhere these days, and every square inch of ground is occupied by one of them.  Directly after lunch Gertie S and I went off to the Opera, there to meet Mother, BG, Ell etc.  \"Samson and Delilah\" was given and very lovely it was.  One knows the music so well and the singing was splendid.  We then drove back to the flat to tea and hastily dressing Ell and I went and dined at the Williamsons, it was long since I had seen either and it was so very nice talking over old times again. </p>\n<p><strong><em>November 22nd</em></strong><br/>\n        Alas I had to return to home and duty today.  I rushed off and did more shopping, and on my arrival <span><em>(at the flat)</em></span> Mother with grave face told me that Barbarina Booth had come to lunch, and I absolutely believed her.  I turned to go into the dining room with disgust and there stood - Skippy - of all people in the world.  I was so relieved I nearly fell upon him and embraced him!  At 2.30 we drove together to Waterloo and there sadly took my homeward train and so ends my delightful jaunt. </p>\n<p>I can't fill in my diary every day here because often nothing happens but garden work and Hospital and it makes me feel utterly uninspired.  If there were not a war on nothing would please me better than to go on in our humdrum way but sometimes in these strenuous days I feel rather lost away from everything and everyone.

Since writing in here nothing remarkable has happened to alter the even tenor of our ways.  Miss H has been away to London for a week to see her man who has had a weeks leave and who has now left again.  I have been very busy having perpetual toothache and making a series of visits to the dentist. Yesterday I got a wire from the Jackdaw saying he was to arrive tonight by the last train at Ilminster and I am going in to meet him.  I suppose this means that he is on his way to the Front once more.  London and the East country has been nightly visited by air raids.  It always is now at full moon season.  The damage appears not to have been very great however and people are getting quite accustomed to keep clear of the streets as soon as the \"take cover\" is sounded.  Mother has practically lived downstairs with Mrs Haby and I am thankful she has her there.  Yesterday not feeling very brilliant I spent the day in bed and amused myself by reading over some of my old Diaries written at Woolwich and Kildare but oh! what blues it gave me.  Why half the men I mention have been killed - but what a gay life it all was in comparison to these days, what hundreds of people we saw every day, endless parties, bridge, concerts etc...in fact the World.

Now of course going up once a week one can't take the same interest. </p>\n<p><strong><em>October 28th</em></strong><br/>\n        This morning as I rode up at 8 to Early Service the world was white in the grip of winter, a brilliant sunshine over the scene that glistened all over with hoarfrost.  All was very still and the roads were quite hard and crisp.  I went to that service to find the \"peace which the world cannot give\" , it certainly can't at present,  in these days of stress and strain, it is a wholesome comfort to go and lay all my anxieties and inward horrors there.  To tea came Miss Busby, Miss Edwards and Gore, a nice fellow who is shortly leaving as he's marked out.  We all sat round the fire after tea and ate nuts and roasted chestnuts till 6.15. when they left. </p>\n<p><strong><em>October 29th</em></strong><br/>\n        I was much surprised to receive a F.P.C <span>(Field Post Card)</span> from DW today saying he was in Hospital sick, but relieved to get also a letter written two days after saying it had been a cold and he was rejoining his regiment that day.  He is by now in the line of course as I constantly see mention of the Ist Cheshires as they are in that horrible Ypres cesspool.  The horrors they are living through fill one with despair, how do they live through it?  The country is in worse conditions than it has ever been before, thousands of deep crater holes filled with water, miles of bog and mud, morass and endless desolation.  Our poor boys.  Oh! how heartrending it all is, and today comes the fearful news of that splendid Italy's severe reverse, in 2 days they lose nearly all their hard-fought ground which it has taken them months and months to gain, not that this will make any difference to the ultimate end except perhaps in retarding it but it will cause such high glee in Germany and do much to raise their morale. </p>\n<p><strong><em>October 30th</em></strong><br/>\n        All morning I spent in cake making.  We shall be about 30 people at this Whist Drive.  I've managed to extract two extra pounds of sugar from my grocer and I've tweaked all the flour out of my weekly ration of 30 lbs.  We have no currants or raisins in our cakes but always use dates now.  Tea also is a difficulty but I'll manage it all somehow.  I feel these days that nothing one can do for them is enough after all the fearful horrors that they go through for us, dear blessed creatures, and its quiet enough for them down here. </p>\n<p><strong><em>October 31st</em></strong><br/>\n        Much bustle and preparation for this evening's show. We pushed the school table to one side and arranged all the little tables in the middle, each with its cards, numbers and ash trays!  We cleared the dining room likewise and had a stand up tea in there.  The bachelor rooms and bathroom came in very handy, for the men didn't have to come in by the front door at all and I was saved much mud there in consequence. We started to play at 4.30 and finished at 7.30 with a tea interval mid way and when it was over we played games till 8.15 when they had to return.  It was all great fun and I hope very much to do it again at Xmas time. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}}, "errors": [], "description": "\n\n\n<p><em>Wynne has been keeping her diaries since 1895.</em></p>\n<p><em>The war grinds on, and the loss of so many friends is becoming unbearable. </em><span>A month when the strain shows very clearly.</span></p>\n\n"}, "september": {"viewers": {"viewer_1": {"order": 1, "title": "Viewer 1", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1917/september/Hinton_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><em><strong>Two postcards of the village Wynne lived in in Somerset, which she stuck into her September entry.

By 3.0 we arrived at our destination and found such a jolly little place lying in the hollow of a step gully, a tiny old world fishing village. We left our machines at a pub and climbed the hill, arriving at our field, where to our joy we found the bug we sort <span>(sic)</span>.  The view was perfect, one could see right over Seaton with its red sandstone cliffs, on beyond to the curving point where the cliffs became yellow and white, the sea and sky were intense blue and all was very still and warm and oh! I longed - well, for all sorts of things.<br/>\n        At last it was time to go.  We had tea in the hollow and then went down to the beach and watched the fish being brought in and sold, all sorts of bogey looking things and the smell! and then we went for a row round to the smugglers caves and so home getting back about 10.0!  rather tired but with a ripping day behind us. </p>\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1917/september/Boone_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><em><strong>This is just one example of the hundreds of notices that appeared in papers all over the country...and of course, these would only have been for those in society who could afford it.

We then rode on to Dowlish Wake where we stopped and had tea in a field, on through Cudworth, up and up a long hill right to the top of Upper Chillington and down home through Dimington.  It was a perfect day, very hot and still and I've never seen the country looking more beautiful, every tree in a different shade of green, all the hedges brilliant with freshness and all simply lined with primroses.  I've never seen such masses and enormous ones; dog violets, periwinkle, and soon the wild garlic will star the banks.  Dowlish Wake is a lovely village as old as the hills, Allowenshay ditto, tucked away in a sleepy hollow surrounded by deep rich pasture land, and the farm we went to there keeps 70 cows! </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_7": {"order": 7, "title": "Viewer 7", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n\n<p>A portion of Philip Gibbs' newspaper report which appeared on April 13th: </p>\n<p>\"51st Still Sticking It\". </p>\n\n", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>A part of Philip Gibbs' article - it gives a flavour of the type of reporting that was going on during this very dangerous period...</strong></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"495\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"1646\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1918/april/Article.jpg\" width=\"495\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_8": {"order": 8, "title": "Viewer 8", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n\n<p>April 25th - 30th</p>\n<p>Country visits and chopping wood for next winter.

The other cutting by Leonard Spray is an account of the return of the German armies.  If these people had been clean fighters and had played fair how much more tragically this would read, but as it is one's heart is stoney.  There is an article in Blackwood this month called \"For Women\" by one.  It is the most fearful reading I have ever read and if the women of England have any souls in their bodies they will see to it that these ghastly horrors are not forgotten.

Its all too frightful. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Dec 9th</em></strong><br/>\n        It has been a vile day, cold, wet and grey.  I was out at intervals all day, from 10 to 10!  I spent the morning in Crewkerne shopping, then after lunch I went up to baby Welfare and had the usual four and at 6.30 I went up again, this time walking in a streaming torrent to the meeting of the W I.  To my great surprise we had 33 or 35.  We had a very cheery little meeting ending up with tea and music. </p>\n<p><strong><em>December 10th, Tuesday</em></strong><br/>\n        A day at home spent when the weather permitted in wood sawing and snatches of gardening.  My morning washing is no longer such a nightmare as it was however, as I now have the water put into a hay box over night and it is quite hot in the morning. Formerly owing to the delightful hot water arrangements of this house I always had to have cold.</p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_3": {"order": 3, "title": "Viewer 3", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1918/december/Torture_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"452\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"1740\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1918/december/Torture1.jpg\" width=\"452\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"452\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"1068\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1918/december/Torture2.jpg\" width=\"452\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_4": {"order": 4, "title": "Viewer 4", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n\n<p>December 11th - 16th</p>\n<p>Election Day on 14th.

It was just the time when the Suffragettes were making such exhibitions of themselves and <a href=\"http://www.wynnesdiary.com/1912_pages/march/viewer_4.html\">I describe Town</a> a wreck from their excesses.  Well they have their way now for we go to record our votes on Saturday.  Fools they may have been then and certainly behaved in a very disgusting way but in this War I think our sex has redeemed any former folly for Lloyd George last Monday speaking at the Queen's Hall to a meeting of women emphatically declared that we should never have won this war without the women and then gave figures of the numbers who had gone on to Munitions, the Land, the Hospitals, Railways, Air Board etc etc.  Indeed there is little that they have not worked at.  If the men had suddenly been called upon to look after the house and babies I bet they would have washed the latter in ink and given it kippered herrings to eat.  We go tonight to hear the Labour candidate speak, one Kelly.<br/>\n<span><em>(Later)</em></span> A most bombastic speaker, a candidate for the job of PM I should think, and a woman speaker.  The meeting when asked to hold up hands for Kelly held up none at all. </p>\n<p>(See also April 1913, for <a href=\"http://www.wynnesdiary.com/1913_pages/april/viewer_2.html\">April 5th diary entry</a> and news of <a href=\"http://www.wynnesdiary.com/1913_pages/april/viewer_3.html\">Mrs Pankhurst</a>)</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dec 12th</em></strong><em><strong></strong></em><br/>\n        What a dark time of year this is, when we get up in the mornings one cant see across the room and owing to the need of economy in everything I dress in the dark.  It is extraordinarily warm which is a blessed mercy with coal at 2/7d per cwt. We never light a fire till the evening and then only of stick and coke, no coal is burnt except in the kitchen engine house and chicken boiler.   I have been sitting on committees from 4 until nearly 7, the first that of the W.I. and then for the Hospital tea and tree on the 23rd.  I have been put in charge of the latter, a big job. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Dec 13th, Friday</em></strong><br/>\n        I am at present amusing myself by reading over old diaries.  The one I am engaged on at present is 1913.  What tons and heaps of fearful parochial and camp work I did, besides all the entertaining and dining out and then the number of times I used to fly to Town!  What a strange difference, when (now) a spoilt dish becomes a calamity, a spot of ink a tragedy, and an extra 2d on the butcher's book an occasion for fear of bankruptcy! </p>\n<p><strong><em>Dec 14th</em></strong><br/>\n        I heard today from Ell, he was just leaving Suez. I cannot help wondering where our feet will be wandering this time next year.  A little house and two servants is my heart's desire.  I long for a small balance in the Bank too for a change, which we can never hope to have in this place.  Besides I am sick of the \"Trivialities\" who live in this village with their petty and most malicious gossip. <br/>\n<span>RED LETTER DAY FOR WOMEN!</span><br/>\n        This was Polling Day and I, a mere woman, went to Record My Vote.  Below is the man of my choice!  My number on the register is 105.  It was so strange today at the Poll to see the women rolling  up and several old <br/>\n        boo boos brought their wives all dressed in their blacks and I doubt if many knew their rights from their left!  Well, its been a great event and hardly won. </p>\n<p><strong><em>December 15th, Sunday</em></strong><br/>\n        I am much elated because my hens have begun to lay again after a cessation of about six weeks! </p>\n<p><strong><em>December 16th, Monday</em></strong><br/>\n        I went up this morning to witness a sweet making of Dorothy Lowes, she is an expert hand at it and makes them beautifully.  Old Mrs L came pottering around and was severely reprimanded by DL who dismissed her abruptly with many dears and darlings as is the wont of people when snubbing one another! The climax being reached when she found that night lights had been bestowed in the same box as her cocoa butter to keep them from the mice. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1918/december/Election_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>Wynne's election day card, for her favoured candidate.

At 4.45 all was ready, and the lions fed - they did feed, and all at length rose up stiff!  At 6.0 a crowd more arrived and the Xmas tree was superintended by Shelley as Father Xmas and he did it awfully well.

It was the first dance ours had been to.  It was really jolly to see people dancing again after 4 years abstinence.  Personally I frisked about with the children like a two year old and by the end of the evening I was dead!

No such four years have ever brought with them such untold misery and anguish to the whole world and one now hopes that better and saner times may come for all of us that are left after this frightful upheaval. Tonight according to custom we all sat up and saw the New Year in.  First we played games with halfpence in the pool.  We then turned our attention to Table Turning but they wouldn't work out, our company being too young and unformed to get up sufficient magnetic current!  As the church clock struck 12 we opened the front door and all went out on to the starlit terrace and dancing round in a ring sang the usual Auld Lang Syne.  The church bells were ringing far and near and continued to ring until 12.30.

Whilst waiting there for my change of bus I realised from the decorations on the King Charles statue that it was yesterday the anniversary of his execution.  Wreaths of scarlet flowers and ribbons, laurel leaves and violets were hung around it from the Jacobite clubs and Royalist families.  How strange that this sentiment should live so long.

Very good it was and one certainly doesn't miss meat under these circumstances.

After lunch H, Win and I walked to Brices Mill there to gather snowdrops which grow in masses in that deserted old garden.  I heard a thrush sing out his high clear call, most perfect.  He sang of his wedding day which comes on the 14th of the month and he told the world at large how very beautiful was his lady and how entirely happy he was. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Feb 4th</em></strong><br/>\n        Today the rain is coming down in a flood so nothing can be done out of doors. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Feb 5th</em></strong><br/>\n        A clear day and H, Harman and Davis have been ferreting.

Poor fellows, one cannot realise the hideous discomfort they live in perpetually.  I heard a vile story about food.  A friend of Aim's <span>(her aunt)</span> got a rabbit from a poulterers skinned and when her cook brought it home she found it had a cat's head!

All sorts of skits on the problems of the day appear in various papers and although things are getting pretty tight everyone takes it all so good naturally.  Personally I find housekeeping a chinese puzzle - it is so awfully difficult to make a variety when one is so limited in food stuffs. We can get no bacon at all, hardly any margarine, of course no butter.  No dried fruits for cakes of puddings, only once a week does the butcher call and fish is fearfully high.

I shall never forget it as long as I live and it seems so odd to think of the food panic we were immediately plunged into and how we rushed off to buy a ham, some flour, tinned goods etc just as if we were preparing for a short siege.  Little did we think we should still be fighting after three and a half years and be going through a real food shortage with a vengeance.  Gold too at once became scarce and we all changed feverishly our bank notes, fearing they would become waste paper!  There again, how little one could realise a paper currency and no gold at all.

I was sorry that letters could not be sent in the Whaling Steamer but I saw the Captain and he told me he would have been only to glad as another steamer would take them on but it was to late\u2026.I do hope that the terrible war will be over long before this letter reach you how happy it must be for all dear friends to return home but I feel sure that many thousands have gone to there bright home above may we all meet in that bright home above with all kind wishes and many thanks for you parcel and letter believe me to remain yours sincerely  Frances Repetto.<br/>\n<span>(I have not corrected any of the spelling, and \u2026indicates additional writing not transcribed). </span></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>From Walter von Poellnitz, 35 Isabellastr., Munich.  26th January.</strong><br/>\n<span>Wynne's Uncle Walter, living in Munich.

This roundabout way of corresponding has its great drawbacks.  Firstly it is not private and secondly the possibility of getting lost is imminent.  Well, I'm all right and hope to hear the same from you about all that are near and dear to me.  I wonder how poor old Thurie is getting on. Of course you are not so much in touch with him as while you were living near London. We had glorious winter weather.  Hard frost, deep snow and lots of skating, tobogganing etc, not that these sports affected me much - things of the past.  I rub on pretty comfortably - of course we have to be careful about money\u2026living rather more expensive than before the War.  However I manage to manage and though I have not grown fat I am flourishing, no asthma, no heart complaint, to bed at 11, awake at 8, very good appetite, so I may have some more years in store for me - which I hope and pray may bring this dreadful war to an end and in time re-establish relations between two nations which have been on good terms for ages.

This is a great surprise as it is a mere nothing and seems so strange that one is forced to think there is much more than meets the eye.  Political trouble seems imminent and it all happening just now when we are on the eve of the expected offensive is most unfortunate.  Sir W R is a man in whom everyone has the greatest confidence - entirely self-made, beginning life as a butler! he is now second to none as a soldier barring Haig.

One dreads to think that even now it may have begun.  Our poor men - may God help them.  Philip Gibbs writing on this yesterday calls it Germany's last effort to impress the people.  They certainly need it if half the horrors which are toward over there are true.

It is an amazing state of affairs, bewildering and quite appalling.  Russia has of course long since collapsed and rushed around like a mad dog biting itself.  Germany made peace with a portion of it, the Ukraine, and now various troops are fighting the Germans and getting beaten.  the most awful accounts of life in Moscow appeared today, the place is full of starving people amongst whom are hundred of erstwhile officers who have been kicked out by their own troops and who with their wives are selling newspapers and sweeping crossings.  Open robbery in the streets is common and it seems to me when a man does not commit suicide he is mysteriously done away with.

Today we had a breadless tea and very little of it for breakfast, but I am determined to keep within our flour ration and this week I shall do so.

Down here in the country we are not pressed in quite so many ways as they are in the big towns, but things like butter, tea, flour are all a struggle to get.  Sugar cards are of course in force now and compulsory rationing for all is near at hand.  Each individual now is allowed half a pound of sugar per week and so we use a good many substitutes such as saxine, honey, treacle and \"sucradraw\", a clear sticky substance like glucose and corn syrup. We have indeed fallen upon evil times but in Germany all is far worse and thousands we know are really half starving whilst clothing is made of paper and shoe soles of wood. </p>\n<p><strong><em>January 5th</em></strong><br/>\n        Whilst working up at hospital today Dr Sibbald has talked over the matter of our quarantine with the commandant and has decided that there must be no communication between us and them for a month at least.  We now look forward to isolation for weeks, such a bore. I've been reading today in the paper about the frightful shortage of meat in the big towns and the endless queues that await food for hours at every big shop.  Its really getting rather awful. </p>\n<p><strong><em>January 6th</em></strong><br/>\n        We have our joint of meat today.  There are thousands who have not, thousands of quite well to do people.  As the paper says, \"one cannot eat ones money or ones War Loan Certificates\", and this weekend meat was not there to buy.  Smithfield yesterday must have been a scene of much distress and the shortage was terrible.  I would not be Lord Rhondda or Arthur Yapp - they cannot know which way to turn.

I feel repaid by my horrible early rising to feed the creatures.  I cannot get over the joy of feeling that I have my dear man home for good, it's such a help materially as well as theoretically for he takes much work off my hands and gives me time to breath and think. </p>\n<p><strong><em>January 8th</em></strong><br/>\n        A very cold day and in the evening snow fell, but not very much.  this afternoon to get ourselves warm we all went off wood sawing and cleaving, a very exhilarating occupation. </p>\n<p><strong><em>January 9th</em></strong><br/>\n        Are we never going to get another mail, its weeks since we heard but today I had a letter from a friend form whom I hadn't heard for about 3 years, viz. White T.  He is at present serving in Salonica.  I also heard from Gen Sandilands, nice little man. </p>\n<p><strong><em>January 10th</em></strong><br/>\n        I had a letter from Ell today.  He is seeing about something which will be a great thing if it can be managed, viz the transfer of our few pennies in India to England.  Not only shall we score on the exchange but shall get better percentage at home now as much of our stuff is only 3\u00bd% and we can get 5% in War Loan.  Much wood sawing has been the order of the day.   The whole family turns out and works these days and as Win and I cant go to the hospital we get quite a lot done.  My hens laid 8 eggs today so I am able to send them off to various friends.</p>\n<p><em><strong>January 11th</strong></em><br/>\n        Today it really had a touch of Spring in the air.  We put up two rose poles and tied roses and all the time there was that curious feeling I know so well when Spring is on the way.  It was very faint and only a suspicion but it was there all the same. </p>\n<p><strong><em>January 12th</em></strong><br/>\n        My son is 15 today.  We hid his presents as usual but could get him no cake alas and so he only had a sponge sandwich.  No fruit is to be had, no icing sugar, indeed these are evil times.  We so far have had no shortage of meat but the butcher now says he cannot call more than once a week.  Mother writes that it is almost unobtainable in Town and so is milk.  She can only get a quarter pound of butter a week and no margarine.  This is the same with us.  I wonder how we are to manage in future. <br/>\n        Cathy is leaving me as she can no longer be spared from home.  It is a bore as I have no doubt she will be difficult to replace, but there are so many big things to worry about at present that a small item like this doesn't worry me at all. </p>\n<p><strong><em>January 13th</em></strong><br/>\n        It has been a lovely day and I really believe I felt a faint stirring of Spring again. Being in quarantine we cannot go up to church and it seems so odd not all trooping forth.  After lunch H, P and I went for a ramble across the fields to the larch copse on the top of Liddons, a strange stillness was in the air and small birds flitted noiselessly in and out of the hedges as if they were bent on secret missions of espionage! To my great surprise right on the top of that exposed hill in the larch wood I found 5 primroses in flower.  Fancy that. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1918/january/Hoarding_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"484\">\n<tr>\n<td><img alt=\"hoarding\" height=\"881\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1918/january/Hoarding_lge.jpg\" width=\"484\"/></td>\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_6": {"order": 6, "title": "Viewer 6", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>January 14th - 20th</em></p>\n<p>Food, snow and a letter from a prisoner of war who has been released into neutral territory occupies this week. </p>\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>January 14th, Monday</em></strong><br/>\n        After yesterday's lovely day we were surprised to awake this morning to 3 inches of snow.  The world looked very lovely so I got up and went out to my chickens.  There was no breath of wind and every twig was thick with snow. The children dressed up in rubber attire and had a great snow balling in which we all joined, and not being so well equipped got thoroughly soaked.  We kept ourselves employed in sawing wood. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Jan 15th</em></strong><br/>\n        A wild night and pouring torrents and not a vestige of snow to be seen.  Very dirty and horrible out today. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Jan 16th</em></strong><br/>\n        Very busy today making scratching sheds for my fowls who are feeling all this damp and cold.  The family's colds are better and all more cheerful.  The following extract out of an American's speech is rather neat: he said \"We'll fight to the end and the Kaiser has about as much chance of whipping us as a celluloid cat has of catching an asbestos rat in Hell\".  A most ingenious turn of thought and so American!  Yarmouth has been receiving a shelling from a raider and today the guns were going like mad. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Jan 17th</em></strong><br/>\n        A perfectly fiendish day, deep snow in the morning and a drizzle of rain all day long, but the snow lay all day and in a howling hurricane the poor Hutches arrived looking draggled and soaked.  They have come for 3 or 4 days and what are we to do if this sort of weather continues.  Enclosed cutting <span><em>(see Hoarding article in previous window)</em></span> shows to what a condition things are coming to, housekeeping is anxious work and I really sometimes hardly know which way to turn. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Jan 18th</em></strong><br/>\n        All day long it has poured and pelted and we have been prisoners in the house.  I was most awfully pleased and interested to get this morning actually a letter from Phil Lyster telling me all about his release and as it is a matter of real interest I stick it in here.  Poor fellow, how awful its all been.  I wrote to him some days ago and I do hope he will get it.  Of course I expect it takes ages but this letter has no date. <span><em>(Lyster had been a prisoner of war in Germany, and could only write cards - but had recently been released with a group into more congenial conditions in Holland\u2026see earlier years for cards and a photo from him, for instance April 1917.

All theatres are closed in America to save coal!  No more methylated is to be sold, a real trial, and so on and so forth. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Jan 19th</em></strong><br/>\n        The frightful weather continues though not quite so wet today.  Today being the weekly day for cleaning out the hen houses and animals we all set to and did it.  Its rather an arduous work these days what with 3 hen houses and four animal pens.  After tea we played wild games such as Bears and Dark Game and Sky etc.  I had a phone message from Ell tonight asking me to go up to the Panto on the 25th but alas I do not feel justified in spending the money. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Jan 20th</em></strong><br/>\n        A howling gale and torrents of rain.  At the moment, 7pm, the Hutches and Baby are doing a jigsaw, Noots on one side of me and Win on the other are reading and writing respectively, and Pink is doing stamps.  The wind is roaring round the house and shrieks down the chimney sounding perfectly awful.  My dear son goes back to college tomorrow alas, and the Hutches also leave.  We are supposed to be in quarantine for another 3 weeks and I am getting a bit sick of this isolation.  No more fresh cases so far but I cannot believe that we can escape. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_7": {"order": 7, "title": "Viewer 7", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1918/january/POW_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>Philip Lyster has been a prisoner of war since the very early days of the conflict.

I can hardly realise it.  I feel like a man in a dream, afraid of waking up and finding myself back in Hell.  I mean Germany. Seven of us left Clausthal on Christmas afternoon at a few hours notice and arrived at Aachen at 11pm the next night when we were first told where we were going to.  You can imagine how excited we were! We spent one day there and then started for Venloo, the Dutch frontier town.  Knowing the Huns as we did we didn't feel safe until the train had actually crossed the frontier.  I cant tell you what it felt like to see a friendly face again after all these years.  Here they had prepared a most magnificent reception.  I should say we were 47 officers and about 200 N.C.Os. as others had joined us at Aachen.  Sir J. Hanbury Williams read us a message from the King and Queen, all the foreign diplomats were present in full uniform, the British Minister Sir Walter Townley,  Gen ? the Dutch General in charge of us and the italian Minister as representing the diplomatic corps all made speeches and then we were given tea by a bevy of ladies. It was almost too much for most of us, I know I very nearly wept!  The Hall was most beautifully decorated with lovely flowers, it was a scene that I shall never forget.  Since everybody has been too kind, I have been out to lunch, tea or dinner every day, sometimes all three.  We are in a big hotel which will hold 180 when full, the senior officers have small rooms to themselves, the others are 2 or 3 in bigger rooms.  It wont be comfortable as there are only two small sitting rooms but we don't care, we are free and that is everything. It will take a little while to find our feet as we have hardly got accustomed to things yet.  Everything here is most expensive - a florin nominally1/8 only has the purchasing power of 1/-.  There are cards for most things, the population only get half an ounce of tea and ditto of coffee per fortnight and bread is only allowed at breakfast.  Still as I say we don't care, we're free.  I am in charge of the Hotel, sort of Mess Secretary and have been very busy naturally getting things straight.  We are 20 minutes by train from the Hague where most people are busy getting rid of their money.  Letters only go now and then when the convoy goes so correspondence will be rather spasmodic.  Will write you again when I feel a little more settled down.  At present there is no question of leave home or people coming out.  I so long to have a chatter with you again.

Philip Lyster was imprisoned at Clausthal-Zellerfeld, a small town in Lower Saxony, in the SW part of the Harz mountains.  He was captured very early in the war, and you can read post cards from him in earlier sections of the diary. He was released into neutral territory as part of a negotiated deal.  As you can read later this year, he actually managed to get married, but at this stage they were not allowed much freedom of manoeuvre. <br/>\n              2.

I was as usual very much rejoiced to see my dear and we went afterwards to a play called Carminetta at the Princes in which Delysia is very clever and all the others good.  From there we went to the Carlton and not being able to get a taxi drove along in a 4 wheeler! rolling up in style into the Palm Court of many joyous memories.  We tried to get coffee and sandwiches and cigarettes but were informed that owing to regulations neither of the two latter could be bought!

This occupation is however a farce, one may go armed with money and a basket as everyone now does but as there is very little to buy one spends hours in waiting and comes away disappointed.  At 12.30 we lunched and proceeded immediately afterwards to the Pantomime where we were joined by Lady Fulton.  It was much the same old show as ever but one missed George Graves who is now at the Colliseum and I wasn't awfully amused.  Still it is always worth seeing and the Duke's box makes it a very comfortable way of spending the afternoon.  What horribly blas\u00e9 sentiments! </p>\n<p><strong><em>Jan 26th</em></strong><br/>\n        Away in the morning to shop at Evans.  Food stuffs are getting very low and so very dear and though clothes seem as abundant as ever the price of everything is enormous.  I went at 1.0 and lunched again with Ell at the Bath Club and we saw afterwards Mrs Pat Campbell in \"The 13th Chair\" at the Duke of Yorks.  Quite one of the most thrilling things I've ever seen and I want to go again.  After the performance thinking to revive old memories we walked to Princes to tea,  ye gods, how are the mighty fallen.  Only a small room is reserved for tea and we were given two tiny slips of toast, half a scone, some very small dry bits of bread and butter and ditto cake. <br/>\n<span>(THE THIRTEENTH CHAIR was produced at The Duke of York's Theatre, London, on October the 16th,1917, with the following cast of characters:--<br/>\n    ROSCOE CROSBY                            Mr. Charles Rock<br/>\n    WILLIAM CROSBY                           Mr. Lionel Belcher<br/>\n    EDWARD WALES                             Mr. Yorke Stephens<br/>\n    BRADDISH TRENT                           Mr. Dennis Wyndham<br/>\n    HOWARD STANDISH                          Mr Vane Sutton-Vane<br/>\n    PHILIP MASON                             Mr. Arthur Finn<br/>\n    POLLOCK                                  Mr Charles Bishop<br/>\n    INSPECTOR DONOHUE                        Mr. James Carew<br/>\n    SERGEANT DUNN                            Mr. Frank Harris<br/>\n    DOOLAN                                   Mr. Denham Charles<br/>\n    HELEN O'NEILL                            Miss Hilda Bayley<br/>\n    MRS.

I received a letter from the Jackdaw by the first post saying he was coming up to Town and would be staying the night.  He has lately got engaged to a girl in Bournemouth and I wanted to hear all about her.  I accordingly went down to Waterloo to meet him at 10.35 and having done so we preceded to the club where I fed him and then we shopped and went to Cox and back to the flat for tea and an early dinner for I took him to the 13th Chair.  Arriving somewhat early we went into the lounge to have a cigarette. Hardly were we seated than two loud reports sounded and the barmaid languidly remarked \"another raid, those are the warning guns\".  This was followed by the police calling \"Take cover, take cover\" and then the show began.  We went down into the theatre and took our seats and then all through the guns banged and the barrage rattled and everyone was perfectly calm and quiet.  I wondered at times what it would feel like if a bomb came crashing through the roof for the noise was so loud that at times we could scarcely hear what the people were saying.  At the end of the performance the Manager came forward and said that as the \"All clear\" had not sounded all who wished to stay were at liberty to do so, and that the orchestra would play to them so we sat and waited for half an hour and then I phoned home saying all was well and as it seemed useless staying any longer we set forth.  A glance into the exit of the Trafalgar Square tube was quite enough to put us off taking cover there and coming to the Piccadilly entrance we found the gates closed so there was no chance of going back by that.  No taxis would look at us and though a few buses were running all were full to overflowing.  Therefore there was nothing to do but to walk and this we did all the way.  The moon was nearly full and it was as light as day.  I left the Jackdaw at High St <span>(Kensington)</span> as he had to go out to Turnham Green and hardly had I got in but it all began again.  I watched the strange scene from my bedroom window.  It was like a Drury Lane spectacle, the great gun flashes across the sky, the tremendous noise and the bursting shrapnel in the air.  Alas I was dragged away too soon and made to beat a retreat downstairs to Mrs Haby's flat where Mother and Ell had been spending the evening.  I was much bored.  I did so want to watch it, it was such a curious experience walking home, the streets were crowded with people doing the same and occasionally a taxi would rush past one, its bonnet being placarded with a large notice \"Take Cover\".  And another strange thing I did and that was to smoke a cigarette all down Piccadilly!  Never did I think I should commit such a queer breach of etiquette!  But on raid nights one does do queer things, and no wonder. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Jan 29th </em></strong><br/>\n        This day at 11.0 I met DW <span>(aka Jackdaw)</span> at the club.  I was very glad to see him and to hear that he had got home last night without misadventure.  We had some tea and then went down to the Abbey.  It is very interesting being in Town with someone who has seldom been here before.  Everything is new to him and I was so glad to show him a little of the Abbey though we were hurried to do more than rush round then we took the top of a bus to Waterloo Bridge from where we walked to the station.  It was a perfect day and the river looked lovely, the sun shone through a faint mist casting a pink glow on all the lovely buildings.  Somerset House, the Savoy, Houses of Parliament etc.  In the middle of the river were a lot of green and red barges.  Dear old place, how I love it all.  I saw him off, then returned to Oxford Street to do some shopping at Evans.  I tried to get some tea there but they had no milk! Various things I wanted I failed to get.  We planned to go to bed early, but at 10 the warning sounded and downstairs we had to go as once again we realised our friends were with us.  This time the All Clear sounded at 1.30 but the special constables declared for safety at 1.0 so up we went to bed.  This time the windows rattled and banged and shook and I think the raiders came nearer our side of Town. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Jan 31st</em></strong><br/>\n        I have nothing to relate of yesterday as I spent the day in bed.  I was entirely happy with my books and writing.  This morning I ventured forth to shop but came home to lunch.  I went to tea with Gertie and coming home the fog was so dense that I literally had to feel my way home.  It was really frantic and the crowds in the tube were appalling as all above ground traffic was stopped. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_11": {"order": 11, "title": "Viewer 11", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1918/january/Cartoon2_small.jpg"}}, "errors": ["Could not find viewer html."], "description": "\n\n\n<p><em>Wynne has been keeping her diaries since 1895.</em></p>\n<p><em>Food shortages, Air Raids - the start of the desperate final year of War. </em></p>\n\n"}, "july": {"viewers": {"viewer_1": {"order": 1, "title": "Viewer 1", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1918/july/Letter_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>Two examples of postal problems during war time.

We had a lady to speak on War cookery who put up with us afterwards and was really very interesting. </p>\n<p><em><strong>July 2nd</strong></em><br/>\n        Our speaker lady left early this morning.  She was a most eccentric little person, a real food crank, brought her own butter and ate no meat, said she had not had a dose of medicine for 30 years and hoped to go to her grave without, but despite all these freaks I wish I could have picked her brains for longer, she was splendid. Hospital again as usual and on with Miss Irish.  Our new convoy arrived today, and such a limbless lot I've never seen - arms, legs, hips all missing, poor beggars, and one has been in bed for nine months on end and another on and off for nearly 18, an ex postman named Gibbs from near Yeovil. </p>\n<p><em><strong>July 3rd</strong></em><br/>\n        The heat continues and every evening we have supper on the Terrace and tea out of doors.  The toil of watering is upon us, its very hard work in the detestable garden miles away from the house. </p>\n<p><em><strong>July 4th</strong></em><br/>\n        A day of very glad remembrance for me but I'm glad also its over.  Old times, that is to say good old times always depress me and just at present I've got a phase on of feeling rather at the end of all things.  I suppose however lots of people feel that way these days. </p>\n<p><em><strong>July 5th</strong></em><br/>\n        A long and rather strenuous day at Hospital as I was on alone all day, in consequence helped with the dressings first, then did the surgery, crockery room, stairs, dinner and so one and so forth. </p>\n<p><strong><em>July 6th, Saturday</em></strong><br/>\n        Hospital again this day, kitchen and fish!  Oh, the aroma, it permeates into everything, and then the washing of the fishy plates and fish kettle.  Oh its loathsome and I wish they would cease having it in the summer.  I was glad when work was done and I could escape into the fees' air. Generally my fate on Sat is liver!  but that is a bouquet of fragrance in comparison to fish! </p>\n<p><strong><em>July 11th</em></strong><br/>\n        The whole village was electrified to hear today of the sudden death of Lord Poulett. <span>(He owned the Hinton estate, was was the local Lord)</span>. The wire came to Bilsdon and immediately all the people issued forth from their cottages to talk over such an extraordinary piece of news.  It appears he got flu followed by pneumonia and as he had a weak heart it was fatal.  An unfortunate family, it never seems as though an heir could become of age for their child is only 9 and the late Earl was 16 when his father died and he succeeded from a cousin whose family all died young.  Its a bad day for the estate, this long minority, for the Countess late chorus girl is not adapted to wise rule. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Poulett\">Poulett family history.</a></p>\n<p><strong><em>July 12th</em></strong><br/>\n        At last the weather has broken and rain is falling.  Every drop that comes down we are thankful for. </p>\n<p><em><strong>July 13th, Saturday</strong></em><br/>\n        Hospital - kitchen again, no odoriferous fish or liver but cold meat, the gods be praised!  Poggy came up at 2.30 and had a talk to one or two, chiefly Gibbs.  I have discovered him to be an extraordinarily clever artist.  He's never had a lesson in his life and I saw some sketches in his book which he had evolved out of his own head, really awfully clever and so well drawn.  This sort of gift is a very curious one, it is of course pure instinct and one wonders if cultivated what would be the outcome of it. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_3": {"order": 3, "title": "Viewer 3", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1918/july/AtBay_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"496\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"355\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1918/july/AtBay_lge.jpg\" width=\"496\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>The full scan above omits the detail bottom right...see below! </p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"496\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"679\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1918/july/AtBay2_lge.jpg\" width=\"496\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_4": {"order": 4, "title": "Viewer 4", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n\n<p>July 14th - 19th</p>\n<p>The funeral of Earl Poulett, the village all agog.

Girls of every age, size, colours and kind, and the little church was full to bursting, and the aroma was in proportion!  There are 470 there I believe. <span>(This refers to the recently formed Women's Auxiliary Army Corps - <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wwaac.htm\">check them out</a>).</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>July 15th</em></strong><br/>\n        St Swithin's Day!  and though no rain fell before 12 it made up for it after all right and as I sit writing this after dinner it's coming down cats and dogs.  Early this morn at 6.45 I rode over the Shepton Beauchamp to leave a note on Mrs Brodrck and Miss Penny, on the way back it was very hot and a high wind blowing and I was glad to get back by 8.0.</p>\n<p><strong>July 16th</strong><br/>\n        This day was all the village agog for it was the day of Lord Poulett's funeral.  It was also my day on duty at the hospital.  All the men and all the staff went but as someone had to remain on duty I pleaded that I might be that one and so escaped this most vile duty.  All the rest went off in high fettle thoroughly enjoying the prospect and all pretending they didn't want to go! At 2.30 the big communicating door between the dwelling house and the hospital was thrown open and there in the huge saloon was the coffin.   It was really a superb sight, the sun shone through the yellow blinds, throwing a pale yellow light on the tapestried walls, the old cabinets, and the softly coloured furniture and the coffin looked like a glittering gem covered with brilliant wreaths of crimson, gold, bronze, pink, purple and white. At 3.0 they all departed and I and the two cot cases had it to ourselves and I busied myself getting tea ready for them and us and the firing party of 33.  They all returned very late at 4.30 so it took them nearly an hour.  Just as I was leaving the Quarter came in and asked if we had heard the news which was that during the funeral a wire came for her summoning her to her little son who we knew wasn't well and who evidently had taken a turn for the worse.  Poor woman, what sad news and shocks one after the other.  I do hope and trust the child recovers.<span> (He did, but he died childless in 1973 and his titles died with him).</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>July 17th</em></strong><br/>\n        A rainy, muggy and dark morning when I went into the garden at 6.15 to gather rabbit food.  We have so large a stock now that they eat up tons.  Lets hope the time will not be long before we eat them up!  I've been bottling carrots today, just 6, its rather a toil and one wonders if its quite worth it but they make a nice change in the winter.  I shall have sadly enough many empty bottles I fear as I have not had sufficient raspberries or black currants and red currants are not good done like that but I am building up my hope on the blackberries which are making a good show of blossom. </p>\n<p><strong><em>July 18th, Thursday</em></strong><br/>\n        After having many weeks of drought the rain now descends daily and we are perpetually in the clouds.

Miss Hall leaves us at the end of this term and we have felt for some time that it would be very nice for them if we could manage it.  I therefore made enquiries from Mrs Wood of schools at Malvern and have received excellent recommendations of Malvern Girls College, and go up on Monday to have a look round. I cant contemplate what life will be like when we are without any of them, it will seem like the early days before any arrived only much worse as then we didn't know them!  I am writing to Mother and Ell about it and am curious to know what they will say.  I am so longing for them to have young companionship and games and all the other advantages of community life and they are both very excited at the thought of going. <span>(Ysobel was 14 and Eleanore 10!)</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>July 21st, Sunday</strong></em><br/>\n        A church full of WAACs again.  Going up this morning we met a lot going to work, their costumes really made one feel unsexed! We are not built for such weird manlike garments and those who owned legs like gateposts and bodies like bolsters did not show to advantage.  One was swaggering along in khaki breeches, her hands in her pockets, a hat on one side and she only needed a cigarette to make her quite complete.  Their hair makes me sick, it flies in angles to the four winds, all dust and twigs, and I'm sure judging from their gentle aroma they never wash!      </p>\n<p><strong><em>July 22nd</em></strong><br/>\n        I travelled up to Malvern today by the 9.0 from Ilminster, changing at Taunton and Bristol, then on by the Midland changing at Cheltenham arriving at 2.40.  I went straight to the Woods who had offered to put me up, only to find that when they received my wire they thought it was Bob and so they wired back \"Delighted\" as though their spare room was full they intended putting him in Mr Wood's dressing room.  Finding ultimately my name on my PC they got me a room at Gold Hill.  Well I had tea with them and then Mrs W took me over to Hatley St George which is the Junior House and where I interviewed Miss Dawson, the Head of it.  I found a large house and garden, a crowd of excited girls who go home tomorrow, a very nice lady and a nose that called for a powder puff.  I went over the garden with her, then the house, and talked about all things connected with it and finally had supper with her and the staff..  Quite a pleasant set of very plain headed females of the usual school ma'am type!  I left at about 9.0 and to the Woods where I smoked a cigarette and talked over matters.  Well the long and the short of it is that on the 19th Sept they both set forth and we shall be utterly bereft. </p>\n<p><em><strong>July 23rd</strong></em><br/>\n        I travelled home again today leaving by the 11.21 with a crowd of girls going home, changing at Hereford and Taunton at which latter place I had two hours to wait.  I met on the platform Vodden <span>(one of her patients at the hospital) </span>who was returning from 3 days leave so I took him into the town and gave him some tea after which we walked around and inspected the place and then on arrival at Ilminster drove him home with me. <br/>\n        This day my friend Philip Lyster was married in the Hague as enclosed wire which I got from him some days ago will show.  He is interned out there and his girl went over to work with the Dutch Red Cross.  I am so very glad of it as his health is none too good and now he will have someone to look after him and nurse him.  What a difference it will make to him, poor one, after nearly 4 years imprisonment. <span>(For the full story, with links to each part, go to <a href=\"http://www.wynnesdiary.com/section_pages/editor/viewer_7.html\">his page</a> in Editor). </span></p>\n<p><strong><em>July 24th</em></strong><br/>\n        I had to go first to Hospital and then to Dimington on W.I. business.

I don't call him a Brittisher at all. We are all quite well at home and Mother is looking a lot better than she did when i away to do my bit at the age of 17 and 6 months.

In the distance  the scene provides a touch of War and its needs, for I see a huge field of stacked flax. the work of women pullers.  These stacks looks exactly like a large herd of grazing cattle, so odd and at the back are three big wagons loaded ready to go.

The Clelands had asked us to tea, first we pleaded we had no means of getting, but they insisted upon sending a carriage out for us and so like a gentleman and lady once more we drove behind a horse!  On arrival we found old Miss Wills and Mrs Lane and a Lady Leslie and two spinster nieces, the three Clelands and ourselves.  We all sat round the dining table and I conversed with Miss Wills who poor old dear is quite blind but so very cheerful, both the nieces were deaf, one stone deaf, and old Professor C (once a very clever man, Professor of Anatomy at Glasgow) is now childish and feeble, so it was rather a \"maimed\" party!</p>\n<p><strong><em>June 8th</em></strong><br/>\n        Hospital day once more, how quickly it comes round.  I've been washing up pots and pans for over 18 months now.  It is very odious work and if one wasn't only too glad to do any kind of war work I'd gladly do no more of this kind.  I went up during lunch to see Vodden.  He looks ghastly poor chap, and Sister in her usual way of favouritism, he not being one, has no sympathy and declares he loves his bed.  When one is having malaria for days on end one doesn't feel much like prancing about.  I wish he could get a transfer to a proper malaria hospital, they know nothing about it here nor does the Dr, but there is alas so much in the country now that there are many hospitals exclusively for it.  It is a weary disease. </p>\n<p><strong><em>June 9th, Sunday</em></strong><br/>\n        Went to Kirk in the evening.  Shelley held forth for 20 minutes again.  I wonder he doesn't know that he cant possibly hold his people for more than ten. I suppose this sort of thing is good for one's sub-conscious self, it certainly doesn't make much impression on one's conscious one!  but I am not a good Christian and I know it.

We started after I had read the Rules with a demonstration by Mrs Rapson on how to mend one's boots.  We also had two songs, a question box - people writing on slips of paper what industry they wish to take up, a little show of War Time cookery with receipts and a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haybox\">Hay Box</a> talk by Annie Coles.

We gardened all day and every day, that really sums up our doings.  Of course the great events of the World continue but even the War and its horror gets monotonous after nearly four years of it.  Zeps have actually visited the East Coast again after an absence of many months and raids have taken place as usual in Town.  They come now, moon or no moon, and Mother, who had seriously thought of leaving Town, has at present decided not to do so as it seems useless.  Ell I hear has at last got a job and leaves for Southampton any day, a remount billet.  I am sure he must be awfully glad that his enforced sick leave is at an end.  I have been reading over some of my old diaries.  Sometimes people see me writing these tomes and they say \"What a waste of time, what can you find to say and I'm sure you'll never look at them again\" but I often do read over the old ones and very interesting I find them, though I wonder whether they'll strike me as idiotic as these old things do.  One thing that may prevent that is that a woman of 38 is not so likely to write such rot as a girl of 18! But I've had a very interesting life - the last years no one can wish to live through again, they have been and still are very terrible, but for me personally the anxiety ceased when my man and Ell came out of it and God has been very good.  At present our life down here seems just to go on quietly from day to day.  If it were not that War still rages and the difficulties of living become more and more problematic, my goodness, wouldn't it be easy to be always happy - having my man home for good is the greatest comfort, he is such a help and such a companion. </p>\n<p><strong><em>March 17th</em></strong><br/>\n        Poggy's birthday!

We left by the 11.0 and buying the Times and Daily Telegraph, we buried our noses in them and read from cover to cover.  The delegates are even now with Foch.  They left Berlin on Wed morning at 5am and arrived at the French lines on Thursday 6pm.  From there they travelled blindfold to Foch's HQ and were presented with the Terms.  We are told \"they were astonished at their severity\"! and asked for a cessation of hostilities whilst negotiating.  This was not only refused but they were given 72 hours in which to say Yes or No.  This they are empowered to do but they will not undertake the responsibility and have despatched a courier to Spa to German HQ asking for instructions.  So now we await with anxiety the answer.  I cannot but think they must accept.

To early Service and 11 and from 5 to 8.  I was on duty at Hospital owing to the Flu.  The plague has been and still is bad in these parts.

The schools however have been closed and have only just opened. </p>\n<p><em><strong>November 11th, Monday</strong></em><br/>\n<em><strong>PEACE</strong></em><br/>\n<em>Signed this morning 5.0am</em><br/>\n        This is the wonderful news which came to hand this morning after over four years of waiting.  We were busy cleaning out chicken houses! when Hilda came flying up saying that Bildsden had brought the news out from Crewkerne.  At once we hung the flags out and tied Peter up with ribbon.  One simply cant grasp all it means.  I was up at the village for Infant Welfare but naturally no one came, then at 7.0 I repaired to the School House where the members of the W I assembled and at 7.20 we all went over in a body to Church, there to take part in a short service of thanksgiving.  Crowds of people went and I am sure all felt it very deeply,  it seemed the natural way ending this most terrible time.  We Institute women then returned to our meeting where I had a little stall of Xmas gifts all of which were bought and then we sang songs and danced about and dispersed with the National Anthem.  Meanwhile, the Kaiser has abdicated! and fled with his son and staff into Holland.  Germany continues to be in a state of chaos and revolution and all the world is upside down with excitement.  I cannot think connectedly, its all like a miracle. </p>\n<p><strong><em>November 12th</em></strong><br/>\n        We read in today's papers of the wonderful demonstrations in Town on receipt of the news.  It defies description.  People all went mad, rushed into the streets, downed tools, hung the town with bunting and just flew about everywhere making as much noise as they could.  Every house of business closed, and at night the lighting regulations being off all the street and windows were illuminated.  How I wish I could have been up instead of which I was washing up plates and pots at Hospital! </p>\n<p><strong><em>November 13th</em></strong><br/>\n        In yesterday's paper the full terms of the Armistice were published.  They are as they should be, very severe, and Germany is now protesting to Wilson saying they were obliged to sign but that in the name of humanity the terms should be mitigated.

Then we came home and had a Thanksgiving Service of our own and we are having no lessons today. <br/>\n</p>\n<p>From Thomas, aged 17 (from Wellington College)<br/>\n            \u2026.Well, I must describe to you our Peace day.  It all seems too ripping, and already two old peace things have come in. First of all the clock chimes all through the night and next we need not draw our blinds, before we got fined if we didn't.  It seems so funny.  Work in the morning went on as usual but towards the end of the third hour a hooter began and went on for the rest of the morning nearly.  In the middle of the fourth hour Millar, the head of school, came in with a notice form Vaughan saying that he had had news from a reliable source that the armistice had been signed at 5am and hostilities had ceased at 11.  In memory there was to be a half.  At 12.45 when we came out of school we all went up to Dormitory and plastered the windows with every kind of flag, some people even hung out their carpets and pyjamas! Dinner was a kind of rag at any rate for Lynedoch.  We seemed to be the only dormitory with any guts.  After lunch College went mad.  The Coll. Pres. got up on the roof and towers and hung dormitory scarves (ie: pot rags as they are called, you get them when you get your colours) all over them.  They then put an old bowler hat on Wellington's bust and finished by turning the fire hose on the crowd which was playing football with lounge cushions and cans in the quad.  Then the Hill, Anglesea and Blucher and ourselves turned on our hose and the unfortunate Bursar who wanted to set up a flag staff got simply drenched. Luckily most of dormitory and myself were upstairs watching from  the window, we didn't get any fun in getting soaked.  Instead we broke the padlock and burst open the door leading to the clock and rained lounge cushions and things on the people below\u2026.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_6": {"order": 6, "title": "Viewer 6", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>November 14th - 21st</em></p>\n<p><em>The British Army begins its march into Germany, and at home everyone prepares for a general election.

We are discussing the coming winter and the prospect of frantic hardships about coal, its going to be a sit tight job and no mistake.  She is weaving the most marvellous plans how we should all migrate to her! dismiss all the servants, get new ones in the Spring, kill off and eat all the livestock and shut up the house!! </p>\n<p><em><strong>Sept 2nd</strong></em><br/>\n        Yesterday afternoon Pink and I went blackberrying, it is an occupation I love.  The still autumn days, the rambling round from hedge to hedge, and the competition as to who shall get the most.  The crop is very fine this year, the bushes being laden with fruit.  Government has organised a public collection and hundreds and thousands of lbs are being gathered for jam.  The news from the Western front continues good.  Yard by yard the Germans are  being slowly pressed back and we are gradually regaining the ground lost, it is a blessed thought and I hope and pray it may continue.  We are capturing thousands of prisoners and poor chaps it seems that they are absolutely sick of it and only too glad to cease fighting. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Sept 3rd</strong></em><br/>\n        To Hospital as usual and I was on alone all the morning so had plenty to do.  Sister is in great distress, her poor young son is dead and as he is the only thing she possessed in life it is indeed a desolate look out for her, one feels so helpless in the face of such loss and grief for she is absolutely alone in the world now.  So far she has heard no details, simply a wire to say he was dangerously ill and then a letter from the Chaplain to say he was buried, nothing more. <strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Sept 4th</em></strong><br/>\n        A day at home and very busy digging potatoes.  They are coming up well and I hope that all will prove as good as it means food for the winter.  Mother came down to the garden and all the family assisted. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Sept 5th</strong></em><br/>\n        Alas! we were awakened by torrents of rain, and all the household said to each other on meeting, \"The Potatoes!\" for we had left them out to dry.  Well all gardeners suffer these vile set backs. Thurie arrived.  He looks thin and worn but seems wonderfully plucky.  It is however the last real bad stroke of ill fortune of the many that have dogged his life that Fate can play him.  Herman was his pride and the light of his life and now that he has gone there is nothing left for him or Lena.  We hear now that H had just succeeded to the Aviation Command in Mespot - its all too tragic to think about. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Sept 6th</strong></em><br/>\n        A great work went forward today and I got the whole household on to the garden paths.  We put the cinders down having sufficient for the two long ones, it looks most awfully nice and will save me weeding for a while.  Every day the papers continue to give us more and more splendid news of our advance.  British, American and French all going forward and the Huns in full retreat, fighting it is true a desperate rearguard action but each day sees more ground gained and more prisoners and guns taken. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_3": {"order": 3, "title": "Viewer 3", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1918/september/JayWing_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>A painting of a Jay's wing by Charles de Mornay - Charles was the friend of Wynne's son.

One had been inclined to credit him with a certain amount of brains but reading a speech like this gives one the impression that his brain is a tissue of lies and mawkish sentiments, and the never ceasing allusion to Almighty God.  Meanwhile the situation in Russia defies imagination.

The Lowes took and returned Mother and we didn't get back till 7.30.  The children discovered the ice bucket and there was no getting away, the fancy dress procession was lovely, the two Jefferies winning 1st and 2nd prizes.

We worked feverishly for our stall and roped in \u00a38.13.0.  The vegetable show was splendid and we actually won 3 firsts for open class vegetables, eggs and herbs!  I hear we have cleared over \u00a347 with which we are well content.  Last Monday H and I went up to Newnham there to meet the solicitor and the builder.  We arrived at about 2.30 after an abominable journey.  The heat was intense and the crowds frantic.  After standing nearly all the way we arrived at length and picking up the solicitor Mr Haines on the way drove out to Broughtons. There we found the Wemyses in the throes of moving, a lovely old mess.<br/>\n        We met there Sir Francis Crawley Boevey our near neighbour and one of the Trustees who came up to see us.  I was much taken with his kind and courtly manner.  We proceeded to go all over the house and decide what needed doing and then they gave us tea on the lawn - mulberries and lashing of cream!

I really am looking forward to my holiday more than I can say.  One long time of real hard work, interesting but a grind as well and not like an ordinary move, however its all over now and here we are settled for a bit over a fortnight.  We brought Martha up with us, parting form her at Paddington where H put her into the tube and the first thing she did was to fall into H on the escalator!

This latter she has had dug and manured and planted with bulbs and herbaceous things, a little lawn in the centre and some almonds, laburnum an lilac all round, it will be quite pleasant in the Spring and Summer.  This day we spent shopping at the stores, a wild lunatic asylum, a mass of struggling people, weary and harassed assistants and hours of wait to buy each single article.  Very tiring and brain turning. </p>\n<p><strong><em>December 18th</em></strong><br/>\n        Today the two girls came back and we went to meet them at Paddington.  After lunch we went again to the stores and frantically tried to get Xmas presents but it is a hopelessgame and deadly tiring. </p>\n<p><strong><em>December 19th</em></strong><br/>\n        I went off this morning to <a href=\"http://www.mrshunts.co.uk\">Hunts Registry</a> in the vain hope of finding a cook, but one clerk just hands you to another who merely tells you it is hopeless, takes your address and promises in a languid way to send anyone to you who applies and that's all.  This utter dearth of servants is frantic. The other day the unemployment pay came to an end putting 34,000 women in to the market and still there seems no servants to be had, everyone is in the same way, nobody has any, many people are doing without altogether and the present time has earned for itself the name of the \"Do It Yourself Age\".  We are assured that after Christmas they will become more plentiful. From Hunts I went off to Evans and bought more things and suffered more buffeting.  At length being ladened from head to foot with parcels I took a taxi and went home in style.  On arrival I found my dear son, H having gone to meet him.  After lunch we all went off to Maskelyne and Devants and there saw many wonderful things, the conjuring was excellent, a man called de Bierre doing the main part following a magical play and scientific electric display. We saw light and heat by wireless and also lightening, all of which simply leaves one amazed at the brain of man. <span>(Note - Maskelyne was dead by this time, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Devant\">Devant</a>, one of the most celebrated illusionists of his age, was about to retire.  It is possible they saw Devant at least, though it looks as if his role has been taken by the aforesaid de Bierre.

The kind Duke sent us two boxes and in the evening Susanna's Secret and La Boheme were given whilst in the afternoon we had Boris Godounov.  Mother and Ella Healey went in the afternoon and the Skippys who it was a great joy to see.  We all met at the box and about half way through Poggy turned up.  The children meanwhile were out with Aim at the Alhambra.  Boris G is a Russian opera but as it was produced by Beecham it was in English which I must say at times sounds very crude! but the music is fine and at time very wild.  I am sure if one heard it often enough it would appeal to one still more.  We had tea at the box in great comfort as usual and after a great struggle managed to secure a taxi to come home in.  They are so independent these days that if they don't like your locality they simply wont drive you! Well we got home just in time to change, have some light food and taking with us the two elder children dashed forth again.  It was a milestone in their lives as it was their first opera, and two more things which added value to the event were that La Boheme was given and it was Beecham's last night of the season.  We like Susanna's Secret very much, it is light farce and very amusing, and of course Boheme is perfect, one cannot see it too often, perfect music and splendid voices.  There is not one poor voice in all his company and it was a joy.  I sat there at the finish and howled as I always do but I'm not at all ashamed .  At the end the audience rose to a man and went mad, they cheered and shrieked and whistled making the performers come forward again and again and then yelled for Beecham.  When this clever but conceited ass thought they'd shrieked enough he came forward with gracious bows and acceding to their oft repeated request made a long speech and practically the house remained full until he had finished.  So ended a memorable day! </p>\n<p><em><strong>Dec 21st</strong></em><br/>\n        Its just lucky that Sunday comes round occasionally or we should all be dead!   Today beyond going to church nearby at St Philips in Earls Court Road we stayed at home.  I don't care much for St Philips , the music is nothing special and the preacher very mediocre but it has the advantage of being near at hand, which is an advantage when you are indulging in late risings! </p>\n<p><strong><em>December 22nd</em></strong><br/>\n        We spent the whole day from morn till evening shopping again, more rushing and scratching and fighting, more agitated and harassed assistants and further fruitless efforts to get what we wanted.  We spent, H and I, a delightful evening dining and going to see \"Home and Beauty\" with my dear Blanche Gray.  The play was excellent, entirely improper and most tut tut but Hawtrey was as good as ever and it was very pleasant rolling there and back in a lovely car with two men on the box! </p>\n<p><strong><em>December 23rd</em></strong><br/>\n        H went off to Margate today to spend the night with Mary <span>(his unmarried sister)</span> poor old thing, she is very seedy.  Pink went off at 10 to pick up Charles and do a day with him, while I took the two girls to the stores once more to do a little final shopping.  We bought buns there and rushed off at 1 to stand for a Pit at Chu Chin Chow, arriving at His Majesty we found that it was closed until Boxing Day so we went on to the Coliseum but finding that de Bierre was on there and having seen him at Makselyne we thought we'd go to the Hippodrome so on we rushed and there in the centre of the front seats we found Pinkie and Charles and so after the performance we all went to the Corner House and had tea together. The performance lasted for hours beginning with a cinema and continued by being a Revue with Robey all through it.  He is good and we all died with laughing.  the whole house was packed and we were high up in the Upper Circle.  I have such a stupid head that I couldn't with comfort look down at the stalls.  We crushed home in the Tube which is horrible these days, fighting and pushing for standing room and hanging on to the straps like so many hams in the larder.

Mother's boy from the cripple home came at 11 and we all went along to the High Street <span>(Kensington)</span>.  We rushed into the P.O. with dozens of parcels and then we all went into Cramer to listen to some records which we intended to buy. We also visited Hopes, Pontings, Barkers, and Derry and Toms.  We returned home like dead flies and lay about snatching a hard earned rest having persuaded Mother to alter her fixed determination to have the presents on Xmas Eve! Thurie came and spent the evening and helped to fill the stockings. </p>\n<p><strong><em>December 25th, Thursday.<br/>\n        Xmas Day</em></strong><br/>\n        I've never spent Xmas in London before in my life, it is a curious experience and to all outward appearances it might be a Sunday.  I borrowed the maid's alarm clock and set it for six but awoke at intervals from 3 onwards because the clock, which looked distinctly anaemic, I thought might fail and lucky I did so for at six it gave forth a few feeble croaks like a sick frog which never would have disturbed my slumbers.  I crept upstairs in the dark and roused my three sleepy children who came quickly to life when they saw that Father Christmas had called.  We all bundled down to Daddy, roused the poor thing well up and made tea whilst the contents of stockings were unearthed.  At 7 we got up and dressed, H, P and I went to the early service at St Philips.  There we found crowds and crowds of people, how different from the little country celebrations, 6 or 7 clergy and people being marshalled by sidemen.  I don't care much for that sort of thing, so unrestful.  For Mattins we went to <a href=\"http://www.westminster-abbey.org/st-margarets\">St Margarets</a> Westminster, a service I always like with its beautiful music and perfect setting.  They now have their old East window back in again which was taken down and replaced by plain glass all through the perilous times.  Canon Carnegie preached and it was nice to hear his irish accent again.  We walked home as far as Hyde Park when a downpour drove us to seek the Tube.  After lunch we did dead fly for a while and after tea we had our presents.  It seemed strange having no tree but anything like decorations are so awfully expensive that it was impossible to contemplate so we just set tables and the presents thereon and all enjoyed ourselves very much.  For dinner we had a huge turkey and the usual plum pudding and then played wild games of Snatchcork with shrieks and yells so that our neighbours must have thought us very trying.  H and I got a lot of lovely things and I have so many letters to answer I don't know where to begin. </p>\n<p><strong><em>December 26th</em></strong><br/>\n        I stayed in all the morning and got through a lot of letters of thanks.  This afternoon we took the children to the British Museum.  It was years since I had been there and their first visit.  A vast place and one wants months to see a third of its glorious possessions.  We simply were in the Brahmin, Buddhist Central Asia and Ancient Mexican and Peruvian sections and I was so fearfully interested and engrossed that I could have stayed for hours but alas the time slipped quickly by and we had to return. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_7": {"order": 7, "title": "Viewer 7", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/december/ArmyCard_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>A typical Christmas card from the occupying forces living in Germany - this one comes from <a href=\"http://www.wynnesdiary.com/1915_pages/july/viewer_1.html\">Major Gore Browne</a> - he had been a Captain under Herbert, hence the reference to Swanage.

At 12.30 we all crammed into a taxi and drove to Drury Lane.  Cinderella is on this year and I think its quite as beautiful as it has ever been and very amusing and clever.  Florence Smithson is Cinderella and is rather improved, not quite so much of an ass as formerly.  Will Evans, Lupino funny as always, and new man du Calion most entertaining.  I laughed a great deal but to my mind no one ever has come up to old Dan Leno, or is it that one found it easier to laugh in those days?  I hardly think that can be so for he was a Prince among comedians.  the colours of the costumes and scenery were perfect.  At the interval we all went and had tea in the drawing room , a not unwelcome break as the performance last from 1.30 to 6.0!  The house was densely packed and I hear there is not a seat to be had.  We got a taxi after much trouble.  The streets at night now are so brilliant again, so different from last year's utter gloom. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Dec 28th</em></strong><br/>\n        My family is indulging in colds, an almost unavoidable disaster in Town where every shop and place of entertainment is so boiling hot and the weather winter.  Poggy kept to the house today very wisely owing to a return of lumbago and neuralgia consequent of the said cold.  I meanwhile took the three <span>(kids)</span> off to church at the Tower, where I always love to go and where \"the spirits of the departed\" are so present.  It is a nice soldier service too and the Padre who came out afterwards to talk to us is so nice.  We are going on Thursday to see the old place under his guidance. After lunch I and Noots went off to see poor Gertie who is in the Nightingale Hospital under treatment for a month. We went all the way on the top of a bus, a way of getting about I like best! </p>\n<p><strong><em>December 30th</em></strong><br/>\n        A very busy day and out from 10.30 until 6.0. H and I went off to the City to try and buy a drawing room lamp but found that they were all so awfully expensive that we returned to the Aux Stores and found a much cheaper one.  The children meanwhile had gone off with a packet of sandwiches to spend the day at the Zoo. We joined them there and had lunch but alas it poured with rain as it nearly always does so we could only hurry from house to house.  Many of the poor animals had to be shot during the War on account of a lack of food and many died from food difficulties of the right kind but they are gradually getting up their stock again. </p>\n<p><strong><em>December 31st, Wednesday</em></strong><br/>\n        When we first came to Town we tried at once for seats for Peter Pan and were told that all seats were engaged for the next six weeks.  The children were dashed as it was their particular wish to see it again.  We happened the other day to mention it to Blanche Gray and a few days later she rang us up, indeed came over to see Mother to say she had procured seats and would we all go with her.  So we all went to her to lunch and afterwards to this Play which is Immortal to grown ups and children alike.  We missed Pauline Chase, but Renee Mayer was very sweet as Wendy and if Peter was somewhat disappointing the whole was so delightful that we felt entirely satisfied.  The house was crammed with children, some so tiny that wails and shrieks resounded when Nanna the dog was banished from the Nursery. It is a mistake to take such tinies <span>(sic)</span>, they only cause disturbance to others.  We had tea in the theatre and ate chocolates, this time with no ill effects for I remember well the last time we saw the play some 5 years ago the chocolates made the whole party sick in the night.  We got back about 6 after which we spent a strenuous night seeing the New Year in.  We played games of skill and chance till 11.30 when we removed to the dining room where we had a lovely supper and drank champagne, drank to the King, then our hostess and then absent friends and last but not least Mdle!!  At 12 we opened the windows and from outside there came prolonged and loud sounds of rockets, hooters, church bells and shouting.  We all turned out on to the pavement, Mother included, and I and the children danced round in a ring with many shrieks and squeaks.  The bells and hooters went on for quite a long time though our street itself was quiet and so ended 1919.  A year of unrest and much badness.  Peace is signed and yet how very far we are from it, for in many parts men are still fighting and the Labour question is still much vexed.  To look at the shops you would never think we'd been at War  but prices are very high of course and food though plentiful is very expensive.  However thank God we are better off in this country than most and in no way can we or may we complain. </p>\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_9": {"order": 9, "title": "Viewer 9", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/december/PeterPan_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"495\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"633\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/december/PeterPan.jpg\" width=\"495\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_10": {"order": 10, "title": "Viewer 10", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/december/EndPiece_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<p><strong>The end page of the  diary, with art work by Blanche, Wynne's Mother, who also supplied the tag. </strong></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"495\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"655\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/december/EndPiece.jpg\" width=\"495\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n</td>"}}, "errors": [], "description": "\n\n\n<p><em>Wynne has been keeping her diaries since 1895.</em></p>\n<p>The house finally settled, the family go to London to spend Christmas with Wynne's Mother. </p>\n\n"}, "february": {"viewers": {"viewer_1": {"order": 1, "title": "Viewer 1", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/february/OpenWindows_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>Wynne was a great believer in fresh air!

A busy day - I've been basket making and my hands are sore and bruised! but I've made quite a decent basket.  I had to attend a sale at Hospital and sat at the receipt of custom of the kitchen dept.  I afterwards had tea at the Lowes and counted out the total gains which amounted to just on \u00a390, and as the residue is to be sold by auction they'll certainly clear over \u00a3100.

So long as we had a war the country was at one but since the Armistice has been signed we are treated to one big strike after another.  Belfast, the Clyde, Glasgow and now London, beside of course the miners who are ever ready to \"down tools\".  Today the Railway are out so that if anyone had wanted to leave Crewkerne they would just have been disappointed for the station was shut! The most extraordinary spirit of unrest is astir and where it will end is a mystery.  The Engineers threatened to cut off London's electric supply but the Govt has stepped in and under the much abused D.O.R.A has decide to use extreme measure which I hope will steady the people  Its all a hopeless outlook, the men strike simply because its a poison in their brains and their demands are nothing short of delirious, always up to now they have been given into only to bring about increased demands but it cannot go on without crippling the country.  All the tubes were shut yesterday and all the waiters at hotels and restaurants came out so that guests had to wait upon themselves or go without.

Beside this two cats greet one at the door.  The interior is a strange collection of miscellanies.  6 China dogs, two of which are red and embrace impossible castles, sit on one chest.  The mantle shelf is a mass of painted tea tins, photographs resting on woollen mats, broken teapots jostling for elbow room with pots of jam, plates, cruets and vases.

I have come to the conclusion however that in these days of outr\u00e9 dancing of the Fox Trot, Chicken Scratch, Tickle Toes, One and Two Steps, these days when the splendid Waltz is no more, that dancing is a thing of the past for me.

This one near Newnham is an old house brought up to date with electric light, water laid on and all etc standing on a rise with the Forest of Dean on one side and the Severn on the other in 18 acres of land.  Well we are quite pleased with it and its worth thinking over.  We missed our connection at Gloucester and had to wait 2 hours then on our return we went and walked about. The town was gay in flags and bunting and there were crowds of people.  We tried to see the Cathedral but they always close at 6.  We put up at Bristol for the night where we failed for some time to get a room, at last we were taken in at a lodging house and given a room belonging to a man who was absent for the night.  It was lucky getting in anywhere but Oh! what a filthy place, they didn't even give us clean linen, the sheets were his! and the pillow cases and towels begrimed, it was more than I could bear and so I remonstrated.  The landlady, a regular stereotype article, was furious and offered to turn us out!  She certainly had the upper hand there for we couldn't walk onto the streets at 10 therefore we had to cave in and I wrapped my pillow up in my dressing gown.  On Sat we celebrated in concert with the rest of the country the Peace - we were to have tea, sports and dancing in the Park but the rain saw to it that we did not so we had the feed and a dance in the schools.

I was very remiss in writing but you will understand that the times were not propitious for correspondence. I was so glad to hear that you were all doing well.  Fancy Pinkie, Nutie and the Baby at College and school!  How the time flows! And yet think of what has happened since you and Herbert were here! I am all right as far as health goes.  Of course I am much much thinner having lost about 4 stone but I cannot complain.  Only my heart has given out and I had to have a good many camphor injections to keep it going.  Also my asthma prevents me from taking much exercise.  I read a great deal, all the more as my evenings are always spent at home theatres and concerts being beyond the reach of my purse.  We have gone through terrible times here in Munich.  While the Commune, the Rathe Republic, was in power the daily arrests of the better elements, officers, titled individuals etc as hostages made one feel very insecure. 10 of the hostages were shot, butchered in the most brutal manner.  One never was sure if one's apartment had not been plundered and pillaged when one returned to it - nightly raids were very frequent, so that doors had to be kept double locked.  After the Government troops had arrived all this was done away with and quiet and serenity reigned again. The new form of government has done away with all that was holy and dear to me - traditions and ideals are destroyed - perhaps for ever.  Will this peace ever be concluded! It is most wearying and trying and the suspense harder to bear every day.  Give my love to all that are near and dear to me.  It is sad to think that I may never see them all again.  I am getting on to 76 so there is scant hope.  And now, with best love to yourself, Herbert and your Mother, believe me, your very affect. old Hamster. </strong></p></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"200\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"344\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/june/Walter_photo.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_2": {"order": 2, "title": "Viewer 2", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n\n<p>June 1st - 22nd</p>\n<p>Gooseberry bottling, Women's Institute Outings, and a sermon-less church service.

To Kirk but no sermon and so one did not have to think of old George Herbert's saying \"when the sermon is wholly devoid of sense, God takes a text and preaches patience\". <br/>\n        I spent the whole afternoon asleep in the sun and after tea we picked gooseberries for bottling.  On Monday we had our W.I. meeting, a large assembly, and settled all sorts of business.  Yesterday we went to Yeovil to have teeth pulled out, I two and H one, and feel nice and free today! </p>\n<p><strong>June 12th</strong><br/>\n        I cannot write a Diary these days.  There is much to do but little to record.  For nearly six weeks we have had endless sunshine and its been quite perfect.  We've sat out, fed out and I've slept out all day and every day. The poor earth got drier and drier, nothing has grown, and the aphis and caterpillars innumerable are eating everything up.  Tonight however a change is in prospect.  I was up Bristol  way looking at a house last week, a very pretty house and garden but a bit too remote I fear, so now we are \"as you were\" and its getting really rather near time. <br/>\n        I've been up to my old Almshouse people today, took them some chibbles (sic) and had a talk with them all, a wonderful peaceful ending to hard lives but oh! what monotony for some who are helpless and bed ridden, its not life at all. </p>\n<p><strong>June 22nd<br/>\n</strong>I see I have only made two entries for the whole of June, its really very neglectful.   Next week I'm going away into Oxfordshire to look at houses and a week ago we inspected two in this neighbourhood, both bogies, and so it goes on, and the time gets shorter and shorter!  One day last week I went on an expedition to Lyme with the W.I.  We motored in charabancs all the way and really spent a lovely day.  D Lowe and I bathed and paddled and spent all our time on the Landslip <span>(?)</span>, a lovely place, it was a perfect day and we got back at about 9.  I get good news of my dears at College and had long letters on my birthday from them all. <span>(On this day Wynne inserted the letter from her Uncie in Munich which you can read in the first window). </span></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"364\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"376\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/june/Ysobel_friends.jpg\" width=\"364\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>Ysobel (on the left) with some College friends.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_3": {"order": 3, "title": "Viewer 3", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/june/DT_Peace_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>A small part of the massive article Wynne stuck into her entry.

How weary one has been waiting and waiting but now at last it is settled and done and extraordinarily impressive it must have been.  I enclose a long account of it.  The fact has excited very little interest here at home, at least in the country.  People hung up a few measly flags, Parson said a few words from the pulpit and that is all.  So different from Armistice Day when we all went mad.  For one thing one feels really sort of unsettled about it as in G at present they have no representative body and where one section now agrees to sign simply because it cannot help it, a dozen others will in coming months rebel at the terms simply because they'll be able to say they did not hold with it.  The anger that some of their party papers are now expressing is a fine specimen of \" Hate\" and I enclose one.  It's pretty reading.  One does not feel that the mere signing of papers will bring Peace.  At the present moment people are fighting in all the odd corners as fiercely as ever and one is weary of the word war. </p>\n<p>The painting as it actually appears.

Last week I went off with my bicycle up to Oxford and stayed 2 nights with Sir Charles Roe and the Pennys and did tons of inspections and found there a little old house which I really think may suit us and H has gone to see it today.  it is quite small and a little garden but I do think in many ways it is just what we want.  It is in a village called Appleford. The immediate country around is flat but well wooded, and the house itself if of old red brick and red tiled, and its title deeds go back to the 26th year of Elizabeth's reign.  The interior is old and quaint with oak beams and old corners and though it is very tiny I do think it could be made to look very comfy.  I returned home on Thursday having done 55 miles. We shall see what Poggy thinks of it, he has gone to see it today. </p>\n<p>(This was a very unusual move, and in fact as you can see later nothing came of it. Buying a house was not something the family contemplated - few did - and in fact in the end when they moved again, it was into another rented house).</p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/june/KingsMessage_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"490\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"1063\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/june/KingsMessage.jpg\" width=\"490\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_6": {"order": 6, "title": "Viewer 6", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/june/German_art_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>As Wynne writes in her June 28th entry, \"where one section now agrees to sign simply because it cannot help it, a dozen others will in the coming months rebel\". </strong></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"440\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"880\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/june/German_article.jpg\" width=\"440\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n</td>"}}, "errors": [], "description": "\n\n\n<p><em>Wynne has been keeping her diaries since 1895.</em></p>\n<p>THE PEACE TREATY IS SIGNED AT LAST.</p>\n\n\n"}, "march": {"viewers": {"viewer_1": {"order": 1, "title": "Viewer 1", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/march/WestAbbey_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<p><strong>Postcards of Westminster Abbey, in its war state.</strong></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"450\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"656\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/march/WestAbbey1.jpg\" width=\"450\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"400\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"592\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/march/WestAbbey2.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_2": {"order": 2, "title": "Viewer 2", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n\n<p>March 6th - 8th</p>\n<p>Provisions in the shops are back to normal, and the sandbags have been removed from the Abbey.

It has been a week of quiet enjoyment seeing friends, shopping and window nose-glueing.  We have been to no theatres because the epidemic of flu is still raging and that naturally is the best way of catching it.  I am going to risk it however tomorrow as Philip Lyster is coming up from Shoeburyness to dine and do one with me and I must hope for luck.  I am fascinated by the shops which make you feel that there had never been a war at all.  They are full of everything, masses of provisions, clothes, furniture, jewellery and now the sweet order has been removed the big stores are crammed with sweets, chocolates and candies but the price of everything is enormous, beyond all conception and how people find the money to buy anything I cant imagine.  There are masses of the most beautiful ribbon a foot wide of dazzling colours and unique designs at anything from 10/- to 43/- a yard made in Lyons, and the shop people say they cannot get enough to supply the demand.  Coats and shirts are anything from \u00a310.10.0, costumes 17 or 20 guineas and so it goes on.  We shall come down to dressing in leaves and twigs.  The Town is congested to bursting, and its fearful getting around. </p>\n<p><strong><em>March 7th</em></strong><br/>\n        One day I strolled in to poke around Westminster Abbey.  It is always a place of great delight to me and I know it very well, it was such a joy to see it in its original condition again, minus the sandbags that is, for they have all been removed and now only the flags in the Edward chapel and the stained glass over the Chapel of the Tombs await return.  All the effigies over the tombs and the coronation chair were removed to the crypt but all are in place again now and indeed one cannot sufficiently thank God that this great treasure has come safely through this horrible war.  St Paul's too and all our ancient buildings are all intact in spite of all the many raids we suffered. </p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"136\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"148\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/march/Flowers.jpg\" width=\"136\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong><em>March 8th</em></strong><br/>\n        I had a busy and an interesting day today.  First to Douglas where I had my stray locks camouflaged into masses! then I met H and we went to lunch, then a hurried departure to meet Brenda at the Aeolian Hall to hear <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NmeMkQcBuc\">Rosing</a> the Russian sing his strange songs.  His style is dramatic and illustrative in the extreme and he sings of death and blood and moans and lunacy till we feel thoroughly depressed and morbid.  The Hall was crowded.  His voice is wonderful and he has the most marvellous compass and flexibility but I cannot away with such music, it does not suit my commonplace mind. <br/>\n        We hastened home as I had to change early and went to meet Phil Lyster at the Troc at 6.15, this meeting was \"according to plan\" of years all through his long term imprisonment we've planned it and at last it has come to pass.  He was little changed but looked older and bit fine drawn which is not to be wondered at.  I made him begin at the very beginning and tell me all about everything and it was most interesting.  He says that during his term he personally received very fair treatment but on his first journey to the first camp they met with various forms of cruelty.  At Cologne the station was full of Red Cross women who came to feed the troops passing through.  They also came alongside their train and being very hungry and thirsty and seeing they had provisions he held out his hand for some water to a woman who offered it to him.  She slowly withdrew it and slowly poured out every drop on the platform, offering him sandwich she withdrew that also and spitting upon it offered it again.  This from a Red Cross nurse.  We went on to the Coliseum, saw an indifferent performance which we hardly noticed as we were talking all the time, and then completed our evening by having a short while at the Carlton but everything closes so early now that I was back home again by 11.30 and found the others still up playing Bridge! <br/>\n        (<a href=\"http://www.kzwp.com/lyons/troc.htm\">The Trocadero</a>, on the corner of Shaftesbury Avenue and Windmill Street, has many mentions in Wynne's diaries.  It was a favourite stopover when theatre visits allowed. It closed in 1965, and should not be confused with its dreadful modern namesake.)</p>\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_3": {"order": 3, "title": "Viewer 3", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/march/Cartoon_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>The Versailles Peace conference became a subject for cartoonists - the wrangling amongst the Allies, the slowness in coming to a conclusion, and the issue of reparations all featured...below you can see Clemenceau, Wilson and Lloyd George marching in line, and then a rather topical cartoon, illustrating Lloyd George's problems that were emerging from the Coalition government.</strong></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"400\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"456\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/march/Cartoon2.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"400\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"374\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/march/Cartoon1.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_4": {"order": 4, "title": "Viewer 4", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n\n<p>March 12th - 31st</p>\n<p>Women's Institute activities are beginning to bring in money, and she hears from her niece en route to India.

We left Town on Monday and once more take up the daily round.  Its always nice to come home but I do wish the weather would improve, its freezing cold, rains all day long and is so dark. <br/>\n        Ever since I got back I've been hard at work basket making, we have the county instructor here for a fortnight but having missed a week of him I'm attending every lesson I can.  We are 31 workers now and at the monthly meeting they sold 56/- worth which is not bad for beginning.  I had a long letter from my Win today from Marseilles.  They stopped at Gib and she went ashore and though they had had some very rough weather she had only been thoroughly sick once, and had found Capt Skipwith, our Skippy's brother, who had been very good to her.  I was so thankful.  There has been a fearful fire at Wellington and half the Dorms have been burnt down.  I am so thankful that it is not Pink's side.  The fusing of an electric wire caused it and within an hour the roof fell in. </p>\n<p><em><strong>March 19th, Wednesday.</strong></em><br/>\n        I find I write a good deal on the weekly resum\u00e9 now.  We have 3 fine days since last I wrote which were occupied in sowing seeds and gardening hard.  For the rest it has rained unceasingly, and the work has stopped outside.  I seldom remember so wet a season.  Sunday was one of our three lovely days and I sat out on the terrace all the afternoon writing, the gnats even thought it summer and \"jazzed and hesitated\" around me in clouds. </p>\n<p><em><strong>March 22nd</strong></em><br/>\n        I have heard today the very surprising and delightful news that Ell has been given command of the B.L.H.<span> (Behar Light Horse)</span> and so he is now Lt Col.

I heard this morning that out of the four girls chosen from her House, she <span>(Ysobel)</span> was one whose name has been entered for the Junior Oxford Exam in July.  All these matters of family news are of great importance to me, I cannot help it, if the poor wretched world is still twisting and writhing though arms are officially laid down.  The Peace Conference continues to confer in Paris and we are encouraged by the hope that all will be settled by 29th March but there are too many Mad Dogs let loose in Europe to be silenced by any Peace Treaty I am thinking. <span>(see cartoons in previous window)</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>March 29th</em></strong><br/>\n        A week has gone by since I last wrote in here and no sign of  a Peace Treaty nor likely to be, they go mildering on in Paris meanwhile the Huns are as uppish as they can be and a faction in Germany is now declaring for the Kaiser and Ludendorff again.  The General Strike of Coal, Railways and Transport workers is settled thank God, and few people realise that the country has been through an awful crisis. </p>\n<p><em><strong>March 31st</strong></em><br/>\n        I got on Wed these P.Cs <span>(see below, of Port Said)</span> from Win and so by now she should have arrived in India.

We had a phone message from Mother on Thursday night in despair because Brenda had phoned to her that her cook having quinsy she could not put her up so she is coming to us on Monday, much to my joy.  Lena forwarded a letter from Walter a few days ago poor old man, he is having an awful time, he has lost 4\u00bd stone, says that the bread he eats consists of bran, potatoes and turnips, that tea and coffee are non-existent, and that no condiments of any sort are to be had.  I do feel so sorry for him and really one wonders if during these terrible times of the last month there he is still alive.  I cant think how he has pulled through at all.

On Friday to my great pleasure came Phil Lyster for the weekend.  He is doing a course at Shoebury<span> (ness)</span> and Salisbury and came over from the latter.  He is looking so much better than when I saw him in Town and we had much interesting conversation about his prison days and also some birds nesting in which he is very keen.  On Sunday we broke the Sabbath and did not go to Kirk in the morning but to the stream and watched for nests instead.  I feel that the Good God was as near us down there as in a \"Temple made with hands\".  He left in the afternoon as he had to be on the ranges early Mon, but is coming again next weekend.

Last Sun also we sat down 10 as the Marriotts came up and Dorothy Lowe brought her two Australians.  The Lowes are entertaining men from overseas for a week at a time to show them a little English home life before they leave the country. On Tuesday last we had our yearly Rogation Service in the fields.  It is a very charming revival I think and was held in a field on the Lopen road overlooking miles of glorious countryside at 8pm, and there in the midst of God's perfect work we asked His Blessing on the crops for the year. <br/>\n        Phil Lyster came this last weekend again and we did an afternoon at Bryces Mills on Sat, taking tea with us.  It was just perfect down there, so still and warm and quiet.  We hunted for birds nests and lazed about and talked about his past 4 years.  He left again on Sunday afternoon for the Plain and goes north tomorrow.  I've been getting up at screech lately, the early mornings are so perfect I cant lie in bed. Poggy came back from his hunt having drawn a blank.  He went to Malvern and saw the girls and found alas that poor Babs was in bed with a cold so she couldn't go out with him. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}}, "errors": [], "description": "\n\n\n<p><em>Wynne has been keeping her diaries since 1895.</em></p>\n<p>Pre-war life begins to assert itself - a dinner is arranged...but the news from Bavaria is bleak.</p>\n\n\n"}, "november": {"viewers": {"viewer_1": {"order": 1, "title": "Viewer 1", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/november/Broughtons_ext_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong>This is Broughtons, their new home at Flaxley, near Newnham, in the Forest of Dean.

We left Hinton End the day after my last entry (October 20th), going to the Lowes who kept us till Thursday, and very comfortable and happy we were.  We spent that time in saying goodbye to all our village bogies and really felt we left a lot of kind hearts behind us.  We came up here by the 9.0 from Ilminster bringing with us Martha, Peter, Tip the cat, and the canaries and arrived here soon after 2.0.  We knew of course that the house was being done up but had hoped to find that trouble well underway, when to our dismay we discovered that beyond the kitchen no interior had begun!  Well there was nothing for it but patience so in the most extreme discomfort we have lived for the past three weeks, dirt, dust, straw and paper being our daily joys.  For 10 days we had no coal and as I am cook I had to negotiate the kitchen with coke and wood.  It puts the lid on the art of culinary pursuits rather!  Then the electric engine having got really cold proceeded to buck and every night we had to return to lamps and the climax was reached on the day when our last load of furniture trailed in and I found that two of my huge egg crocks were broken and ever so many eggs smashed  and sat down beside them and nearly wept!  However nothing lasts for ever.  The coal came, the water engine was mended, the electric light recovered and all seems better, but after nearly a month we still have only three rooms completed, the drawing room, Babs' and Pink's room in which latter we are sleeping whilst the men are doing ours and Nootsie's.  The drawing room is sweet and sunny and faces south.  It is pale primrose which suits the old mahogany furniture.  On the floor are our two beautiful Persian rugs and on the walls the dear watercolours from Springfield and some of Hal Jones'. The piano stands with its back to the room across one corner and has a Bokara drapery to hide its innards, another such hanging conceals a closed doorway and our humble collection of old china with heaps of flowers complete a very pretty room.  The curtains the old gold ones from Brookfield look lovely having been well darned by BG and me! I hope we are going to be very happy here.  I'm prepared to love the little house with its very nice garden  and its 18 acres of charming fields full of big old trees, the views too are perfect, on the one hand the Severn runs like a sliver streak all along the valley backed by the Cotswolds and on the other side is the great rise of the Forest of Dean which has been simply glorious in its autumn dress of red, gold and brown. </p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"495\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"362\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/november/Broughtons_int.jpg\" width=\"495\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"144\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"141\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/november/Cupid.jpg\" width=\"144\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p> <br/>\n        Several people have called: the Vaughan Hughes who seem very nice; the Colchester Wemyss who own Westbury Court, a beautiful old place, but have lost their money so live in a tiny house at its gates; the Kellys, the rector of Westbury, and some people called Shelley but I refuse to be \"At Home\" whilst the house is in this frantic state, so no one has entered it yet. We've visited both churches (Westbury and Flaxley) and are struck by the extreme emptiness of both.  Westbury has no excuse as its a large place, Flaxley is a tiny village but the parson preached a decent sensible sermon today and I only wished there were more to listen to him. Close by the church is the ancient seat of the Crawley Boeveys who have been there since the year one - horribly renovated by this man's father who employed local labour and has spoiled the old house, but nothing can mar the perfect beauty of its setting surrounded by wide level fields and lawns and backed by perfect wooded hills.  The church is frightful within and without and quite modern I should think, red brick, slate roof and no tower, quite horrid, and such a sadness when there must have been an old one somewhere.  I must find out all about it.  The Crawley Boeveys don't live there in winter but always depart to Town. We are working hard at the garden here, finding much rank neglect but its all going to be lovely and I am most awfully pleased with my new home. </p>\n<p>The full width start to a new life: </p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"497\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"263\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/november/Nov16_topPage.jpg\" width=\"497\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_3": {"order": 3, "title": "Viewer 3", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/november/Broughtons_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"196\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"316\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/november/Broughtons_Window.jpg\" width=\"196\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Ysobel and Herbert sitting outside the garden windows.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong> And below, a shot of the garden with Herbert enjoying a book (uncharacteristically, as they were both normally working in the garden from morning till night!)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"495\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"382\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/november/Broughtons_HKJ.jpg\" width=\"495\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>A photo of the Church at Flaxley, with the Crawley Boevey house in the background, taken when Ysobel visited there in 1990.</strong></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"495\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"342\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/november/Flaxley.jpg\" width=\"495\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_4": {"order": 4, "title": "Viewer 4", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n<p>November 27th</p>\n<p>The house gradually takes shape - the painting is almost done - and the gardening begins in earnest!

We have been here 5 weeks today and yet are still  hand in hand with the painters, however we begin to see daylight.  The dining room, landing and stairs are now in their hands, my bedroom is complete and looks very nice in its fresh pale green.  I've hung up heaps of my photos and pictures and feel at last happy and comfy.  The garden too goes on apace, we've done all the flower part, planted heaps of bulbs and herbaceous stuff and soon the roses and shrubs will be here, it should all be lovely and I'm longing for Spring. Yesterday I returned the call of the Flaxley parson's lady but found her from home so went on to Blaisdon Hall, the \"seat\" of the MacIvors.  I've never seen a larger private house, I felt like a microscopic flea approaching its enormous portals.  It stands in a huge park backed by wooded heights with a view from here to Australia, quite new and not very beautiful battlemented towers sort of thing, but they seem pleasant people and I hope we shall see something of them as they have three girls.  I heard from Walter yesterday, now that communications are open once more he often writes, and it is most interesting to hear truly of the state of affairs.  What awful times they have lived through and are still doing as the Spartacists continue to hold up horrors over them and food too is very scarce.  Coal is at a premium and the mildest of luxuries unobtainable.  I put here the envelope of his letter showing a surcharge German stamp and the usual Freistaat stamped over it, how odd this seems from an autocratic country like Germany. I feel so sorry for the Hamster, a proud man most truly humbled, all his traditions shattered, all his ideals broken - for the country one cannot help feeling the justice of this humbling but for many an individual it must be very bitter. </p>\n<p>(The envelope and stamps are in the next window.

What a good thing we had all taken our departure or you would never have got rid of us all this time! I left 25 a few days sooner than we had intended as there was a rumour the buses and trams were coming out so I thought it best not to delay, or there would be no means of getting out.  It was a false alarm as they stuck to their posts and were not in sympathy with the strikers at all.  Strange sights were seen on the roads, people who were brave and thick skinned not minding what they did hailed motorists and motorbikes with the sidecars for lifts.  I should never have summoned up courage to it and really motors stopped and offered seats to pedestrians.  People had to walk 12 or 14 miles to work in the mornings and back again in the evenings.  Buses and Trams were simply laden, the Specials were called out again to regulate the traffic, the Police were wanted in different parts of London to keep order but with it all the public kept smiling and the Londoners showed their usual stolid front by bowing to the inevitable.  Really these times seem to bring out the best in people, for they do many little kindnesses to each other, and are so chatty and friendly and so good tempered over it all.  But we are still kept very short in the way of food.  I had to go to town and went in to one of <a href=\"http://www.kzwp.com/lyons/cornerhouses.htm\">Lyons</a> places and had a snack - a little fried fish, price 8d, one small piece of bread, and being still hungry thought I would have a portion of apple tart.  \"As you have had bread\", the girl said, \" you cannot have pastry\" so I ended by having some weird milk pudding!

Now although one can no longer hear the guns, the surging anger, hatred, malice caused by incessant labour trouble certainly make one feel that insanity is astir throughout all lands and one wonders again and again will things ever become normal again.  These times to look back on will no doubt be interesting but they are not enviable to live in. </p>\n<p><em><strong>October 2nd</strong></em><br/>\n        I spent yesterday in bed with a vile throat and head. Today I arose after breakfast and felt decayed and so cold.  After lunch not being able to bear the house any longer I went out and we gathered apples till tea.  Such a perfect crop.  The strikers still hold out so does the Govt and the latter are quite determined apparently to break them.  Crowds of volunteers for all sorts of work have come forward and many trains are running.  Much transport is being done by lorries, motors, steamboats and aeroplanes and a motor service has started from Manchester to London every half hour or so!

Already his goods are coming into this country and the irony of it all is that if the World boycotts him in trade he cannot pay the enormous Indemnity.

I do not know if Hinton End is the complete address. Well, my last was rather incoherent.  The fact is that I received the same morning a letter from my lawyers in Edinburgh saying that they could not comply to my request about forwarding the moneys due to me since the beginning of the war, having received instructions from the Custodians of Enemy's moneys not to do so.  The sum is about  \u00a31500 and as I have been forced to live on halfpay which gives me \u00a322 a month for 5 years I was rather upset.  Subsisting on such a sum meant genteel poverty with a vengeance.  The money is not lost I hope but it will be some time before I am able to handle it.  But enough of this.  I will now try and tell you how I have fared all these dreadful years of anxiety.  Deprivations began very soon after the outbreak of hostilities.  White bread disappeared and the black bread, a mixture of rye, potatoes and turnips, was very nasty and not nutritious. Sugar, tobacco, rice were not to be had, or if so at famine prices.  As for sardines, sausages, ham etc things where with to make one's meals a little interesting, they were only to be dreamt of.  So on the whole life was more or less a burden.  To cap everything the Armistice which made Germany absolutely powerless, forcing it to accept every condition imposed upon it, then the revolution which gave us the coup de grace, did not serve to make life worth living. <br/>\n        We Bavarians were the first to upset authority, depose our King and make havoc among institutions which had been up to now the welfare of our country.  More shame that the masses were misled by a pack of Galician Jews and the rabble collected about them.  But this was not the worst.  After the King's flight the Communists got the power into their hands and a reign of terror commenced.  The proletariat was armed, plunder and rapine reigned unpunished and unrepressed.  I was never sure of not being seized as hostage, nor sure if on coming home in the evening of not finding my rooms plundered and my housekeeper murdered.  At last the Government (sic!) troops entered and defeated the Spartacists.  The shooting was tremendous and a lot were killed, also some of the regular troops.  Now quiet is restored for the time being.  But as we have no coal, and very little bread, it is probable that the scenes of lawlessness may repeat themselves.  The winter will bring great discomfort for me. The house has central heating and no coal to heat with, so I have to put up an iron stove in one room only and heat with turf which gives little heat.  So you see that the Hamster is not to be envied. <br/>\n        I had a very good time last month.  I was stopping with Prince Quadt, an old friend of mine, who has a big place in W\u00fcrttemberg, Very fine, very good cheer so that I gained half a stone in weight.  You would be astonished if you saw me.  I am as thin as a whipping post and my clothes hang on me like on a clothes line!  But I am very well, not depressed (more than necessary) and hope to pull through all right.  Some good friends have helped me a little now and then, else the workhouse or a quick end would have been my lot.  I am so glad to hear that you are all well - how often do I think of the happy days at Aldershot - the pleasant house, the lovely garden and all your and Herbert's kindness.  God bless you both for it.  With best love to you and yours, I am ever your affect. old Hamster. </strong></p>\n<p>(The Prince of Quadt referred to is probably Bertram, 1849-1927, 1st Prince of Quadt of the family of Quadt zu Wykradt und Isny, a family with roots back in the twelfth century).</p>\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_2": {"order": 2, "title": "Viewer 2", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n\n<p>September 1st - 12th</p>\n<p>A distressing accident while blackberrying causes much hilarity, and a lovely trip to Lyme produces a man from Wynne's past. </p>\n\n", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"132\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"117\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1919/september/Flowers2.jpg\" width=\"132\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong><em>September 1st, Monday</em></strong><br/>\n        Alas Mother left us today after nearly 4 months stay and we miss her much.  Yesterday she spent in packing and washing her hair and this morning by the 10.52 she and Grace and the canaries all took their departure.  Sept has begun with a lovely day.  We seized upon the front garden, Davis mowed and we cleaned out and tided all the beds. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Sept 2nd</em></strong><br/>\n        I awoke this morning to a high wind and torrents of rain and darkness. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Sept 3rd</em></strong><br/>\n        Such pouring torrents still come down and so we set ourselves with much energy to turning out and cleaning up drawers and cupboards against our removal.

It was a perfect afternoon, still and warm, and we picked hard in all directions.  Shortly before tea I heard distressed cries and on looking round beheld a bedraggled figure covered with mud from head to foot, BG having fallen into a bog!  I rushed to her assistance, divested her of her shirt and jacket which I dragged in the grass and she luckily having a petticoat on, borrowed Pink's coat and sat thus eating her tea whilst her clothes hung round on the cornstalks drying.  How we laughed.  Her boots were caked with mud and her gloves stiff with it!  I left the party at 6.30 and went to the W.I. meeting, the last I shall attend. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Sept 9th</strong></em><br/>\n        A lovely day so we took the opportunity and went down to Lyme.  On arrival we all went and bathed, it was ripping and we had a great swim, then afer dressing we went along the shore paddling to where no one else was and had our lunch and explored and then went for a row, the girls never having been on such an errand before.  Nootsie and Pink took oars, the former catching one crab!  We stayed out for an hour and then had tea and left sadly at 5.15 that being our last train.  Whilst walking on the beach I beheld the brown and fat proportions of a man in a bathing suit and a gold bracelet talking to a huge fat female and I recognised Harry C but did not stop and he didn't see me - how strangely time has altered one's feelings!<br/>\n<br/>\n<span>(This must refer to Harry Castleman, mentioned often in the early diaries when Wynne was living at Brookfield.

We sallied forth all round the home fields before lunch and after we took our tea down into the Lopen fields.  I do so love roaming round and browsing on these quiet still warm days, each in a different direction giving  family whistle occasionally and then assembling for tea.  We took BG over some hairy fences in spite of violent protests and much rebellion but she managed to \"leap high oer the fence\" like<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_Jim\"> Sunny Jim</a> and we got back at 7.0. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Sept 20th</em></strong><br/>\n        BG and I employed ourselves in mending the yellow curtains, a long and weary job, and during our arduous labour we amused ourselves by discussing tombs and the \"laying out \" of corpses!

What can the mind be like that can produce productions such as these - is it madness or mere effrontery?  No comments are needed but like August John and many another of that ilk he has his following or they would not allow his \"Night and Morning\" to be erected in London.  Punch's picture here filled us with joy but when there is so much that is lovely in this most beautiful world it seems altogether an outrage. This is Good Friday - at Home how different to out here.

I'm having a seed bed made near my seed house and if only the rain will return we shall be content. <br/>\n        I often think when in the future these diaries come to be read, if anyone would be sufficiently interested to open one, how the thought will occur to them of the utter triviality of our daily lives.  That the world is indeed full of huge happenings, or one might call it tragic chaos, is only too true but to dwell on such things spells morbidity and it is up to one to work in our daily circumstances as free from that as possible. </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 5th, Easter Sunday</em></strong><br/>\n        I have been reading this morning Dresser's book,<a href=\"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2339136W/The_power_of_silence\"> \"The Power of Silence\"</a>.  There is much there that is sound and wise.  The human mind, unless self sufficient, which mine certainly is not, is so apt to get befurred and fogged, revolving as it were upon its own axle.

We have a good road all the way now so it takes much less time to get there.  The little place was full right up and Knight officiated, our Padre being at Kitale.  He preached a good sermon on the necessity of looking at things from a right perspective, an attitude much to be recommended these days when amidst much that is large and important one is awfully inclined to allow the many smaller things to fogs one's brain. </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 6th, Monday</em></strong><br/>\n        We have had a spot more rain so I feverishly dig and delve.  Pricked out first seedlings. Tonight at sunset we saw the most marvellous cloud effect, two vivid ends of rainbow, a rain storm sweeping over the plain all misty and pink whilst  on the left rolling masses of pink and grey clouds which turned to orange backed by intensely blue sky.  We do get some perfect sky scenes out here. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_3": {"order": 3, "title": "Viewer 3", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1931/april/Berkeley_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<p><strong>Another development Wynne notes.

It is naturally full of the large happenings of the world.  I have seldom mentioned India here but for years that unhappy trouble has been growing more and more acute.  Gandhi, the amazing man who was imprisoned, has been for some time released and continues on his wild career.  Serious riots are reported from Cawnpore and elsewhere and the whole thing is rather a nightmare. </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 8th</em></strong><br/>\n        H and P off to Kitale on business, wanting also to go on to Elgon after lunch to listen to Admiral Crampton who is standing for Legislative Council this year as well as Kirkwood. Meanwhile at lunch  the mail arrived bringing letters from Eve, Ell and K and a wire from the latter saying \"arrive Eldoret Wed, coming on by goods\".  Immediately the place became a hive of activity getting ready for them. Eve wrote of a disastrous hail storm which had wiped out their oats and indigo. </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 9th</em></strong><br/>\n        Such a busy day. At 10.30 while busy with a thousand things there arrived Mrs Trench with Mrs and Miss Crampton, the former showing the latter the mountain area.  Then, hardly had we sat down to lunch when Mrs Harold Hill drove up bearing Sir Elliot and Lady Colvin, old friends of Mother's in India. They took pot luck - real miraculous feeding! At 3.30 they departed and almost at once Colonel Kirkwood arrived with Ell and K from Kitale!! - thrills and excitement, and the rest of the day passed in the same. </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 10th</em></strong><br/>\n        The Lugards brought our mail out today and amongst the letters was one from Frank by Air.  It acknowledges the one I sent to Tilda on March 6th.  He also sent a picture of the arrival of the first Air mail at Port Bell, Kampala, which picture had likewise travelled Home by Air.  HowI should love to have seen that.  What a moment.  Its a fact now that we are no longer isolated from the world! </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 11th</em></strong><br/>\n        We have a gang of 8 men on the front now, perhaps we'll get a move on.

Ell took K out riding this morning, it was the first time she had ridden astride and it seemed a success.  She has hunted a lot in Cheshire.  This is my dear Noots' birthday, bless her. </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 14th, Tuesday</em></strong><br/>\n        Owing to the shortage of rain we are having trouble with water and all day long M'Coy has been pumping only to discover we found that he had omitted to put the end of the pipe into the water!  Such is the native mind.  The Lugards brought out the mail and the paper tells of another attempt to wreck the Delhi express.  They managed it all right but loss of life was not as bad as it might have been.  I've been having a long talk with Ell on India, he takes a very serious view of it and is not at all reassuring.  I wouldn't be the new Viceroy Willingdon - a most frightful job.  This autumn is supposed to be the critical time but all the time its critical as far as one can see and how can it all end. </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 15th</em></strong><br/>\n        This month half over, its flown, and tomorrow Ell and K leave.  I'm awfully sad, its all been so jolly having them. </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 16th</em></strong><br/>\n        The presence of Ell and K is much missed.

The house seems so quiet without them and one misses the wireless which requiring a new battery is silent.  After tea Mother and I went gardening.  I am cleaning the long border.  I wheel her to the scene of activity and she knits and talks to me whilst I grub.  H also came along and dug couch, and now that the Rose garden terracing is well under way I'm taking my gang on to this part to glean the grass which has got to look awful. </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 18th</em></strong><br/>\n        The return of the wanderers at 12.30 found us immersed in chores, picture cleaning!  I've found a thing called \"Bon Ami\" which is splendid for glass and everything is having its face washed.  They brought with them the mail, and also the amazing news that the King of Spain has abdicated.  Thus after 15 centuries that country is now a Republic.  All through his reign it has been torn by revolutions and conflicting parties and now that they have their will, things with no one at the helm must surely become more and more chaotic.  His was a wonderful character and the whole thing is a tragedy.      </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 19th</em></strong><br/>\n        Everyone writing from Home refers to our really desperate condition there.  Unemployment, national extravagances amounting to disease, the Labour Govt powerless to extricate the country from the frightful burdens in which they have plunged it and Lloyd George playing around like a mad man.  From all one can judge the feeling among many appears to lean towards a Conservative party and many have turned over but unless it is a live one it will  be just as useless.  Owen writes, and he really lives in the know, \"what we want is a live Conservative party and a Tariff\".  It is certain that no country can go on for long \"overdrawing\" as England is doing, it all reads like a nightmare. </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 20th</em></strong><br/>\n        The day began well!  On going to say good morning to Mother I found that she had been indulging in a severe nose bleeding but was quite cheerful and thought nothing of it.  I then proceeded to my store cupboard and there right across it and concentrated upon a dish of meat were millions of siafu ants.  I had the whole thing rushed out into the yard  and then applied boiling water and paraffin.  They are disgusting and it makes me sick to see these seething masses moving swiftly along.  Well, to counterbalance this the water is now OK.  How soon one gets to find a thing indispensable.  For years naturally we had none laid on and now if it goes wrong for even a week one feels as though the worst has occurred. </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 21st</em></strong><br/>\n        My Mother is in for a liver attack, one of her periodical ones.  I am worried, it is exactly like dear old Gran's complaint, nothing can be done it just must wear itself out but is so painful and vile whilst it lasts. </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 22nd, Wednesday. </em></strong><br/>\n        Our engagement day, a never to be forgotten event in my thrice blessed life.  A meeting here today of the District Council.  Much conversation and acrimonious argument. Also the mail bringing letters from Eve and vile news from India. </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 23rd</em></strong><br/>\n        I am rushing everything out as fast as I can, pricking and planting and as I write heavy rain falls, just quite splendid.  I've made a new bed too on one of the terraces and pricked out a million seedlings, collected all the Gerbera in one big area and made a Canterbury Bell colony near the drive.  Tyack turned up to lunch, so very nice to see him, one's old friends have petered out it seems to me, and the new ones don't come up to them.

The article speaks for itself and where this suicidal policy is going to land the country is beyond conception. On the other hand the World Slump in prices is ruining the individual and consequent chaos reigns.  Unemployment is no bogey of the imagination, but thousands are living on the dole from choice and a nation of \"unemployables\" is growing up, an amazing state of affairs.  One wonders if there exists a spot on earth which is not affected by the universal trouble.  Even on a desert island I fancy the price of coconuts is up! </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 25th</em></strong><br/>\n        We all trailed up to Elgon Club to register our votes.

I expect he is very pleased and it shows that he has the general confidence.  Opposite I put a strange advert of the new <a href=\"http://www.wynnesdiary.com/1931_pages/april/viewer_3.html\">Berkeley flats</a>, really what will people invent next.

I feel sorry for this lone man who really does have a very large share of bad luck all round but who is always cheerful and philosophical in spite of it all. </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 28th</em></strong><br/>\n        Shaw and Billy Symes came along today. The latter is going Home immediately and wants Pink to take over charge of Frank's farm for him. That young thing \"Billy\" has just done an amazing thing.  The Montgomerys introduced him to a girl they brought out the other day and after knowing her for a few hours he proposed and was accepted!  To contemplate lifelong companionship with an individual one has only just met seems to me a bit risky, it is of such stuff that disasters matrimonial are made.  I am hoping that this is to be an exception for he's too good for that sort of thing.  How Shaw will miss him. </p>\n<p><strong><em>April 29th</em></strong><br/>\n        Up drove Billy Symes and Upton.  They and Pink then went up the hill to Frank's place and after due inspection returned to lunch.  Billy looks scared! I think he must be amazed at himself and this act of impulse.

No one looking on at that gay assembly would have thought that many were down and out and that few whilst ringing the old year out could look forward with any sense of ease to the coming one.  The last few days have been more than hectic preparing for the event and the whole family set to making our dresses: a cabbage, radish, carrot and gardener, Mother being as busy as the rest. <span>(Wynne's mother, Blanche, although very crippled, had managed to come out by sea to visit them)</span>.  Just as we were having a dress rehearsal who should appear but the Taylor family on their way to a children's party at the Lugards.  They seemed outwardly cheerful but their lot is about as hopeless as it well could be as they are now in the hands of a mortgager who is about to foreclose, and unless they can sell or get someone to take over the mortgage they will walk out of their house and off their shamba* in the clothes they are wearing as there is a lean on the furniture as well\u2026and to this they have come after about 16 or 17 years toil and moil. <br/>\n        Well at about 3 we went forth leaving Mother and H to guard the house and arriving at Kitale took our things to one of the tents set up for this evening's guests, and had tea.  Soon various people turned up and after sundowning we all went to dress.  It was a great success, a lot of people, many original dresses but alas a good deal of mufti, a most unusual thing at this particular show but I fear a sign of the times.  We left for home at about 12 and found all well on arrival. </p>\n<p><strong><em>January 2nd</em></strong><br/>\n        Each morning now we are victims to the hot weather wind which blows at various hours most of the day.  All through this land there is that dry hot feeling and dust ladened distance, the plains once more are covered with unnameable veldt fires and at night assume an almost theatrical appearance but although no one likes this time of year what have we to put up with in comparison to India and many another place out East. <br/>\n        The Padre came to spend the night.  He is full of his trip Home and produced many photos.  I greatly wonder if sufficient funds will be forthcoming to afford him much longer, church finance is at a low ebb and the means of raising money nil. </p>\n<p><strong><em>January 3rd</em></strong><br/>\n        Yesterday was Eve's birthday.   She is 59 this year! for I am 52 in June.  Ye gods, how frightful! I'm trying to get through Xmas aftermath letters, such a collection I don't know where to begin. </p>\n<p><strong><em>January 4th</em></strong><br/>\n        At 7 this morning I heard the car go off.  Poor Pink had to go down to see the wagon off to Kitale with the coffee, not much of a Sunday morning for him.  Then directly after breakfast he went off to fetch old Ashby, the father of a boy lately settled near by, and they spent the morning in the spruit* after butterflies. Pink took him back after tea.  He is a very keen \"bug\" collector.  This I may mention is a great factor in Pink's life, he is getting a very fine collection and spends most of his spare time at it. <span>(T.H.E.Jackson became a well-known lepidopterist. On his death in 1968 his enormous collection was split between a museum in Kenya and the Natural History Museum in the UK. Several of his discoveries were named after him). </span></p>\n<p><strong><em>January 5th</em></strong>,<em><strong> Monday</strong></em><br/>\n        The first Monday in the New Year!  Mondays are no longer \"black\" for me, but I remember once long ago bemoaning the day to Martha, and her reply: \"Mondays black?! Why its a new day, a new week, and new work.  I loves me Mondays\".  Ever since perforce I've loved mine too! I spent most of this one remaking lampshades and cushion covers of some of the lovely stuff mother gave me at Xmas and as we now have clean furniture covers we look really smart.  The girls are busy now every day reconstructing their stables, converting them into loose boxes. </p>\n<p><strong><em>January 6th</em></strong><br/>\n        A spot of gardening today and my totos* cutting hedges, a very long job.

This wonderful old car Pink bought in 24.  \"The old Dodge\" has become a sort of local celebrity and we are really proud of her.  This morning we too were on the rampage.  I had the little machine room turned out and every box of rubbish we sorted and cast.

My blessed son is 28 today.  Two things happened that I must record.  The old store has been pulled down and all its remaining contents were brought down here. Amongst them was a small leather covered case which no one seemed to know anything about.  Upon examination it was found to be Aunt Maria Elliot's dressing case given to me by Mother and completely forgotten! and in it the amethyst set and long chain and a heap of small bits of jewellery I had completely wiped out of my brain.  Ages ago I realised that the amethysts were astray and concluded they had been stolen but of the very existence of all the rest I had become entirely unaware.<br/>\n        The next event was the arrival from K of the wagon bringing with it the old dolls' house.  This had been left at home and stored by the Shelleys for us at Newnham but moving house they could no longer.  We found on unpacking it very little broken and now we are going to set about and renovate it.  It is a joy to see all the funny little things again. </p>\n<p><strong>Jan 13th</strong><br/>\n        Mrs Kirk is giving a series of cooking classes and I went over today with the Leonards for it.  We learnt about fruit crystallising and when I have more leisure I shall try my hand.

What can be contained in a registered letter from London - we all say \"wool\"! for one of my various works. </p>\n<p><em><strong>July 8th, Wednesday</strong></em><br/>\n        The peaceful order of our ways was somewhat disturbed today.  A lovely morning during which I \"digged and delved\", and at about 1.0 when we came in for lunch we heard over the hill a tremendous noise of labour shouting, a sure sign these days of locusts.  Over the hill they came, a huge swarm.  Down rushed Pink and the Neopara's whistle sounded, all our crowd turned out and stood by but they whirled round and down and did not settle, but spent the night all over the trees in the spruit and it only remains to be seen if tomorrow morning early they descend on us.  After lunch the biggest storm we've had for years arrived, the noise was terrific, thunder, lightening and a deluge and we were in a sea of rushing water.  In my little kitchen with its tin roof it sounded as though all the fiends were let loose. The mail came in to calm us down.  It brought me 3 books from Arthur Owen.  This more than busy day  ended for me by being bitten by Miggles.  The little creature has become unnaturally excitable these days and wont stand any correction.  He had seized hold of the rain gauge and on my scolding him flew at me and bit my elbow.  Must have got a nerve I suppose as it was rather painful and felt like it does when one knocks one's \"funny bone\". </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_3": {"order": 3, "title": "Viewer 3", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1931/july/WGJ3.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<p><strong>Winifred Gladys Jackson, n\u00e9e Llewhellin </strong></p>\n<p><strong>1879 - </strong></p>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"368\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"237\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1931/july/WGJ1895.jpg\" width=\"190\"/></td>\n<td><img height=\"250\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1931/july/WGJ2.jpg\" width=\"178\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"350\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>The monkey bite turned sceptic, and because this was pre-anitbiotics, the only solution to septicaemia was amputation.

He is supposed to have forged his kipande I hear but as a rule they just fine them for that. However we've sent in another today.  Our last Standard gave an appalling account of the locust plague, it is said that in some areas they are miles long by wide and we can see them each day flying thick over the plain.  I dread their arrival up here but there is so much young maize up now that they may not come, but our heart aches for these same maize planters.  To lose all one's crop just this year seems quite too terrible and of course it means famine in the Reserves. </p>\n<p><em><strong>June 3rd</strong></em><br/>\n<em>King's Birthday and Electric Light. </em><br/>\n        Derby Day! How many hundreds and thousands of people's hearts are burning with expectation today? Over the whole world there are ticket holders for the Calcutta Sweep and the (Dublin) Irish Hospital Sweep for which latter two million pounds have been subscribed, even the house of Jackson had a venture in each!  Well, having failed there we have today gained in another way for today we are revelling in our Electric Light.  It is an actual fact and we all sat around in the drawing room wondering if it was all a dream.  We felt we had to indulge in something to drink Mother's health and a very genuine sense of gratitude was felt by all for really its just too lovely for words. </p>\n<p><em><strong>June 4th</strong></em><br/>\n        Capt House left us today.  The installing has taken very nearly a month.  Our rain break continues and though was have a little it is the real June break which comes along every year up here and the days are truly lovely, warm and still and sunny and the garden is a real delight.  We should be very gay this year. </p>\n<p><strong><em>June 5th</em></strong><br/>\n        Our wedding day and we have been married for 30 years! How utterly splendid its all been and how good in every sense.  Pink returned today bringing with him the most disastrous accounts of the locust plague.  They've eaten up acre after acre.  It makes one's heart ache, the whole thing on top of the starvation prices is more than a tragedy.  Well, who knows, they may come here and if they do one must just put a decent face on it but I will not meet trouble.  Moore was away somewhere and on his return he found his whole house eaten out, carpets, blankets, bedding etc  whilst one of the Tyack boys returned from Nandi with the tale that at his home on their arrival people all turned out, leaving a small toto to look after a newly born baby and on their return found the locusts had eaten it - I cant believe  this, but neither could I have believed the incident of the bedding etc if I did not know it for a fact. I hear the Dowlings have closed down this year and dismissed all their labour.  It really is a frightful nightmare. </p>\n<p><strong><em>June 6th</em></strong><br/>\n        Here are <a href=\"http://www.wynnesdiary.com/1931_pages/june/viewer_1.html\">two pictures</a> of changing London.  How shall we recognise the Town when next we see it.  The Hotel Cecil! Once the resort of only the very rich, the place to stay at if you had the money, but fashion changes all, no one who wishes to be thought \"it\" goes there now, and the Ritz, Savoy and Carlton hold sway, besides several other huge caravanserai the names even of which I don't know! </p>\n<p><strong><em>June 7th</em></strong><br/>\n        Charles de la Harpe came along this afternoon bringing with him the leopard skin he has been curing for Mother but unfortunately the native skinners had left so much fat on that the hair came off in the curing so he brought another of his own as a substitute.  We couldn't let him do this so gave him one of ours.  H and I went off to Kirk.  The little Padre who has been told with appropriate tact that he hasn't the gift of tongues, read to us a sermon for over half an hour!  So foolish when we've all got so far to go.  We didn't get back till past 2.0. We also had a special locust prayer which prayed that this country might be kept from locusts which seems to me beside the mark as it is already eaten bare from end to end. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_3": {"order": 3, "title": "Viewer 3", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1931/june/Dorchester_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<p><strong>This time, the record of a grand hotel opening.

We went down to the forest and found the whole place swarming with butterflies of every sort and kind, great groups of them collected over patches of moisture and flying up and down the road.  An ideal spot.  We lunched and slept and after tea walked down across the bush towards the ridge.

En route to Base Camp, Himalayas. </p>\n<p>Dear Mrs Jackson<br/>\n        I thought a line from here might interest you, to let you know how we are getting on. <br/>\n        I had a short but very amusing stay in Bombay before Smythe arrived.  I was met by a fellow called Oslen who had been instructed to do so by the people Marge had been staying with in Madras.  He strongly disapproved of my hat and took me off at once to buy one which was a little less barbaric.  After this he had further trouble in making me conform to civilised ways; he gave me an excellent time though, among other things I saw my first \"talkie\" - I rather liked it. <br/>\n        I had a good many things to do - seeing that all the Expedition goods were landed free of customs etc - and when Smythe arrived we left directly for Ranikhet.  The journey up was very hot and dusty as I suppose all Indian journeys are - through vile country. At Muttra (now Mathura) where we changed, we had a five hour wait and so we went along to the R.A. Mess.  We were given baths, dinner and far too many mixed drinks, with the result that we nearly missed the train and passed the rest of the journey in a very pleasant condition!  From Kathgodam we were taken in a bus for fifty miles into the hills - rather a wonderful drive.<br/>\n        Ranikhet is a delightful spot - right in the midst of oak and chestnut covered hills. We were given the Forest Bungalow to live in, and there we spent a very pleasant three weeks making all the arrangements.  People were frightfully good to us and did all they could to help, besides giving us a very good time. It was my first view of Army life in India and I was very interested. We were asked to stay at G.H. at Nani Tal which was great fun. <br/>\n        The arrangements on a show like this involve rather more work than one would imagine, and we had our time well filled.  Everything was ready by the time the others arrived and we left two days afterwards.  All sorts of firms had sent us things and we had to leave masses of stuff behind.  Huntley and Palmers sent us \u00bcton of biscuits landed free at Ranikhet, also Ovaltine, Malted Milk, Chocolate etc appeared.  The most acceptable gift however was a new portable H.M.V with 40 records. <br/>\n        We have been marching for 14 days now.  I am in splendid company and I like all my companions very much indeed.  The journey has been through wonderful country, range after range of forest covered mountains.  I've never seen such complicated country. the flowers are glorious and Holdsworth, the botanist of the party, is in his element. <br/>\n        We have had frequent views of the great peaks of the Trisul Range which we have now passed. Their features are on quite a different scale to those of the Alpine peaks.  Owing to the strange plastic (?) ice, enormous hanging glaciers, more than 1000 feet thick, form in every possible place on their faces.  Another feature in the thinness of the ridges, through which you can see the sun shining from a distance of twenty or thirty miles Everything looks fearfully formidable. <br/>\n        Three days ago we crossed over the Knani (?) Pass from which we got a superb view.  We saw the whole of the Kamet and Badrinath ranges and over the great glacier region where the Ganges is supposed to rise.  We are going to attempt to explore that part but how much time we will have for it depends on how Kamet treats us. <br/>\n        Life is very good at the moment - days are full of interest and evenings in the mess tent are huge fun.  One does not know whether or not to look forward to our arrival at Base Camp where the holiday part of it ends.  I think we all do though.  Our equipment is excellent - we each have a small Meade Tent to ourselves while the sleeping bags are splendid, they are wonderfully comfortable and can be regulated to four degrees of warmth. <br/>\n        I'll add to this if there is time at the Base Camp from where the next Times despatch is to be sent by runner.  I hope you can read some of this as writing in a sleeping bag renders my normally bad writing dreadful. <br/>\n        I hope you are all well and that things are doing satisfactorily.  One feels amazingly remote from Kenya here and one forgets all the problems of rain, fences etc.  My love to you all.  Eric. <br/>\n        PTO<br/>\n        4th June, Niti<br/>\n        We are delayed for two days here owing to transport difficulties.  We are 2 marches from Base Camp and have a lot to do sorting out kit etc which will enable us to cut short our stay at B.C.  As O.C. stores I am very busy making up provision boxes for the high camps.  We leave tomorrow.  This is just going off with the despatch runner.  In haste.

Our hut which is a little rest house of the D.C.'s <span>(District Commissioner)</span> consists of two tiny rooms, no window, and two openings for entrance.  We thought at first to do without nets but the mosquitoes soon arrived so we fixed them up.  Sometime during the night I was awakened by the sound of matches striking, and found it was poor Pink, mosquito hunting, a huge hole in his net having let one in. Yesterday on arrival we were met by the chief, we presented him with a blanket and he returned a little later and asked us if we required eggs, milk and chickens!  Accordingly they arrived, the cock being released wanders about in a friendly way eating crumbs and coming into the hut and I feel a murderess. The night was warm and still, not so today, as I write this in the evening for a violent thunder and rain storm has just broken over us with the usual preceding hurricane.  The forest was obliterated by thick clouds and heavy rain and one could scarce believe it was the same peaceful place in which we have been wandering all day.  We went off at about 9.30 armed with lunch and wandered up and down all day getting some new stuff and several enormous caterpillars.  The road which has been cut through the absolutely impenetrable forest reminds me of the aisle of some immense cathedral for the trees which meet far overhead are like huge gothic arches.  A lovely spot. </p>\n<p><em><strong>June 20th</strong></em><br/>\n        Last night when we returned we found tea all laid and the table decorated with flowers!  Kisuelli being an old hand at safari is a gem on these occasions and one can leave all arrangements to him.  He enquired by the way last night if he should make bread to which I replied certainly, how he intends doing this I know not but he evidently has ways and means. After a good day's hunting including also a long fruitless search in pastures new we returned getting just caught by a violent storm.  When we got down yesterday there were not many butterflies around, it was early and too cold, so after a bit of a search we decided to go to another place.  There we came to a track leading to the far forest and up it we took the car.  What a track.  I wonder the car didn't break in half.  We stopped at the edge of a sharp drop and walked on and on right down to a river.  Here we had lunch and Pink waded across.  I sat down to await his return, choosing as it proved the better part for he came back not long after disgusted at complete failure.  This part of the country has been devastated by locusts, all their crops have been eaten, the maize stands stark and bare and even the  buffalo grass is but sticks, a dreadful prospect. </p>\n<p><em><strong>June 21st</strong></em><br/>\n        After a long day in the forest fearing lest the evening storm overtook us we hurried home and were horrified at the frightful noise the car made.  Pink examined her innards and fears trouble.  I hope this really is not so, with us stuck out in the wilds many miles from a garage.  She wants oil, and hearing a car passing we hailed it.  It proved to be Dr Ford of the Missions and he took our toto with him to bring back the necessary.  I only hope it isn't some mysterious break.  I walked this morning to the Mission house up the road.  All the way locust devastation is in evidence, not a thing has been left them and the prospect is indeed tragedy.  After tea we returned to the forest for possible moths but found only 3.  Instead we were rewarded by the most marvellous sight, fireflies in every direction, just like a scene on the stage, thousands of tiny lamps flitting here and there. </p>\n<p><em><strong>June 22nd</strong></em><br/>\n        I am keeping camp today and shall pass the time writing and sewing.  Meanwhile the local chief is holding a Baraza outside in the compound, an interminable and never ceasing flow of conversation or rather babble holds sway.  The chief I presume is hearing petitions and adjusting grievances, anyway it sounds as though no one were paying the least attention to anyone.  There is one amongst them dressed up to the nines, a skin, horns and a huge head dress of sticks decorated with masses of feathers.</p>\n<p><em><strong>June 23rd, Tuesday</strong></em><br/>\n        I've just seen my son off for the day, he goes to pastures new and I shall be interested upon his return to see if he has met with any success.  I am thankful that no Baraza holds sway outside today. I must confess that about tea time yesterday I had got a bit tired of the infernal din!  I hear on enquiry that the much dressed individual here yesterday was a Jelua witch doctor.  How I wish I'd had my camera for one seldom sees anything like that in our more civilised parts these days. </p>\n<p><strong><em>June 24th</em></strong><br/>\n        This new place is another forest about 10 miles distant and the hunting ground is the old road through it to Kakamega, long since in disuse.  It winds its way through leafy shade and is utterly remote and fascinating.  Soon surely the forest will have claimed its own again.

Kamet</p>\n<p>Dear Mrs Jackson<br/>\n        A short, grubby note about our progress might interest you.  We spent many days trying to find a route up to here from Camp 3, and at last yesterday this camped was established by Smythe and I who spent last night here.  Tomorrow he and I intend to push a light bivouac camp from which we hope to have our hit at the summit.  We may be joined by Holdsworth who is at the moment at Camp 3 with the others. <br/>\n        We really seem to be on top of the world here.  Great Himalayan ranges  have sunk beneath us and the eye travels for hundreds of miles amongst the highest mountains of the world.  Through a gap there is a wonderful view into the vast plains of Tibet - a stupendous contrast from these ice-bound regions.  Kamet towers above us - a wonderful sight amongst its snow devils and ice armour.<br/>\n        Our ice bed gave a series of great cracks during the night, which made us suspect that we had camped on a small hanging glacier.  We passed a good night though.  Nights are long up here as even when the weather is fine one has to be in one's sleeping bag by 4.30 or 5 unless one is climbing. <br/>\n        I hope you will excuse this letter - altitude has a queer effect on one's mind as well as one one's limbs - for instance Smythe has just put a throat pastille in his mouth a lit a match!<br/>\n        My salaams to you all, yours very sincerely, Eric. </p>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"490\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"583\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1931/june/Shipton2.jpg\" width=\"490\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"496\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"459\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1931/june/Kamet.jpg\" width=\"496\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_8": {"order": 8, "title": "Viewer 8", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n\n<p>June 25th - 30th</p>\n<p>Home again, and Wynne hears from Eric Shipton, who was on the successful attempt to climb Mount Kamet in the Himalayas. </p>\n\n", "description": "<td>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>June 25th, Thursday</em></strong><br/>\n        Alas our little holiday is over.

I've got into the habit of waking about fiveish.  I make my tea, it is just what Mother used to do.  As each day dawns now one's thought is, will the locusts come today?  Yesterday we watched the immense Suk swarm as it processed along the plain and everywhere huge fires mark its passage.  I hear there is a large collection under the bluff.  One can only wait and hope. These pictures of Kamet are from the Sphere, how strange it is to think of Eric, so short a time ago sitting quietly with us here and now actually on this amazing venture. I have just finished reading Arnold Bennett's last book, \"Imperial Palace\", a tome of over 600 pages.  This sort of effort after having written over 70 books is really an achievement but though well written and clever doesn't appeal to me at all.  I am so tired of the present day custom of calling a spade a shovel and all this bald dealing with every intimate detail of life. In the Sphere I find these pictures of the newest thing in hotels, <a href=\"http://www.wynnesdiary.com/1931_pages/june/viewer_3.html\">\"Dorchester House\"</a>, and it seems to me it is the Imperial Palace to the life. </p>\n<p><strong><em>June 29th</em></strong><br/>\n        Locust news as usual, the whole plateau is a screen of smoke. </p>\n<p><strong><em>June 30th</em></strong><br/>\n        A page of prophecies!

Will the day ever come when she overruns Europe.  Stranger things may happen.  The other cutting is from the Standard, its fulfilment according to the woman should come along in the immediate future.

Sadly she was not aware that this was a fake, published by Charles Hindley in 1862 - it has appeared in various versions with different end dates for the world, but in fact has no connection to the famous lady.

I seldom felt anything like the heat in that arid spot.  Quite a lot of people present.  On the way home we drove through masses of locusts, clouds of which were flying over Soy way, filling the horizon, most disgusting, but no one seems to fear them as we did 2 years ago. Billy Symes to lunch.  He is chungering Frank's farm, and gave us news of that one who had been ill with flu and tonsillitis - far better stay in Kenya!  <span>(Chunga in swahili means to care for or look after). </span></p>\n<p><strong><em>March 2nd.</em></strong><br/>\n        The Padre wrote some days ago asking us to go into 64 <span>(Eldoret)</span> for the Agricultural Show.  I wrote to thank and decline on account of petrol, however he came up today to say if we could meet him in Kitale he would take us out himself. As one looks across the Plains they look today as though they were filled with volumes of yellow smoke - locusts! But this afternoon a sharp storm broke accompanied by a fair amount of hail which I imagine will damp their ardour somewhat. </p>\n<p><strong><em>March 3rd</em></strong><br/>\n        Into Kitale where the Padre picked us up and after lunch at the Hotel we came out here, a fine road now-a-days, how different from 6 years ago. </p>\n<p><strong><em>March 4th</em></strong><br/>\n        We got here yesterday about tea time, luckily escaping storms with which the surrounding country was full.  The Padre lives in a very decent little house built for him by the Diocese, solid grey stone with tin roof, it is entirely unimaginative but serviceable.  Opposite is his toy, a little grey church of concrete blocks, quite frightful but nice inside and furnished with light wood pews and blue altar fittings.  The hassocks are covered with swara skin <span>(swara is swahili for antelope)</span>, very neat and original.  I noticed on the altar of the side chapel two of the brass vases were shell bases! an incongruity that did not seem to strike the Padre!  Having arrived at this peaceful harbour, how many lives have they been responsible for I wonder? The house and church are set down in a large plot of ground and I long to get at it and create! At present there is nothing but a few straggling geranium bushes and age-old coreopsis.  I've suggested his handing over the care of it to some gardening woman of the Parish.<br/>\n        We went down into the town this morning to shop, a dud place it is, really little better than Kitale. On the way we went into the R.C. church - very well looked after, very clean but with the usual R.C. ornateness of cheap rubbish. </p>\n<p><em><strong>March 5th</strong></em><br/>\n        On re-reading the concluding remarks of yesterday's entry they strike me as being narrow and intolerant, \"one man's meat is another man's poison\", no doubt. We are all travelling to Rome and must all choose whatever system seems best to us.  The day of the Show proved fine throughout.  The new Governor opened it at about 2.30 and Colonel Swinton Hume held forth in a long speech. The exhibits were for the most part excellent and I was particularly struck by a section called Farm Exhibits which was won by J.D.C Harvey of Spring Valley Farm, Moiben.  It consisted of every sort and kind of farm produce and was complete down to the most minute details, beautifully arranged and thought out.</p>\n<p><em><strong>March 6th</strong></em><br/>\n        We left 64 about noon and were lucky enough to get through without rain.  Met Nootsie at the Club and came straight home finding all well.  Pink busy shelling from morn till eve, getting 600 bags ready for Kirkwood's wagons on Monday.  Sent 1st letter by Air Mail, the first to leave this country.  85,000 letters were sent.</p>\n<p><strong><em>March 7th, Saturday</em></strong><br/>\n        Rain last night and so this morning I planted grass on the two small terraces.  The front operations have actually started! </p>\n<p><strong><em>March 8th, Sunday</em></strong><br/>\n        There came to lunch today two nice creatures, Billy Symes and Guy Nattel.  There are very few young men about these days who are not either boring or pogbaggish but these two are neither and I wish we saw more of them.  Symes is Shaw's manager and Nattel is looking for land to buy.

One thing he was discussing was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Maeterlinck\">Maeterlinck's book on the White Ant</a>, an amazing work which he is lending us.<span> (But see this link, to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Marais\">Marais</a>, for the real story about this book)</span>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>March 29th</em></strong><br/>\n        Billy Symes came at about 3.30 and after tea they both left us, both so nice.  The former is one of those young things who really does get down to it and whose outlook on life is one of determined optimism, a refreshing one these days and seldom met with. </p>\n<p><strong><em>March 30th</em></strong><br/>\n        Our 3 came home this afternoon and brought with them some lovely fish, the result of their labours, a great treat in this country. </p>\n<p><strong><em>March 31st</em></strong><br/>\n        I think the rain has gone away again, it is a sad tragedy having planted out masses of gerbera which are now all dying. The terracing of the rose garden slowly proceeds but it all looks quite mad to me, however Pink has it in hand. This has been a bad day - a day for me of fretful porcupining\u2026I had occasion to look up something in a Diary of 1917, bringing to my mind again those momentous times which seem to me now so great and spacious with their happenings of enormous import and I could not but compare the present which much though I love it has a way of thrusting forward all its tiny trivialities and one allows them to assume proportions of ridiculous importance!</p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_9": {"order": 9, "title": "Viewer 9", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1931/march/Decor_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<p><strong>Along with pictures of fashion trends, Wynne stuck in these ideas for the new decor. </strong></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"495\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"187\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1931/march/Decor2.jpg\" width=\"495\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>And below, a room with the caption: \"A modernistic cretonne in warm sunny colours with bright accents of red and blue is used for these window curtains, the screening curtains being primrose net.

When I step forth forth, the grass is silver with dew and everything glistens in the fresh sunlight.  It smells so good too and I love the complete absence of even the slightest breeze. We had a full day today, at work from 7.30 to sundown planting out delphiniums, acquilegia, wall flowers, nemesia, cynoglossom and dahlias but alas no rain so they all had to be watered, an arduous labour. Mother came out both morning and evening with me and sat in her chair knitting and reading and basking in the sun. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 2nd</em></strong><br/>\n        We are alone tonight the 3 having gone off to Hunts for the weekend.  It seems quiet in this peaceful room, the only sound being the \"cricket on the hearth\".  For 3 days now no rain has fallen so each evening I have to water, and its an awful game really, especially when one has only bath water. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 3rd</em></strong><br/>\n        I had intended having a good morning's letter writing but to \"elevenses\" came the V-Ps who stayed till lunch.  It was sometime since we had met so there was much local gossip to be got through.  After lunch being sure more or less of peace I deliberately lay down on the sofa with a book and slept solid till tea. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 4th</em></strong><br/>\n        Our 3 returned for lunch and brought with them 5 fish! Also there came Capt House and his lorry bringing all the stuff for the electric lighting.  Have I even mentioned this most marvellous happening, that Mother is presenting us with it is so very wonderful that I really cant grasp it.  He returns next Monday to begin operations and meanwhile we are putting up the engine house.  This morning three magnificent leopard skins were brought in and we bought them for 18/- each. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 5th</em></strong><br/>\n        Good rain!  Today's paper contained the budget, this most anxiously awaited trial!  An extra 2d on petrol, and certain other items which my brain cannot grasp.  Snowden seems satisfied with the general state of affairs which is more than the general Press appears to be, but what budget ever pleased everyone.  I see the King of Spain is at Windsor.  I wonder where he will ultimately live. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 6th, Wednesday</em></strong><br/>\n        I've been planting out the girls' border today and because the buck ate everything in it last year I've filled it mostly with snapdragons and larkspurs, neither of which they care for. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 8th, Friday</em></strong><br/>\n        There came today Charles de la Harpe to lunch.  He is a character and no mistake, his never ceasing flow of conversation and his funny old sentiments.  He took one of the leopard skins away with him to cure for Mother who is going to send it Home to the Duke of Bedford.  Then to sundowners (which they don't drink) came the Js and just before dinner Hunt rolled up invited by the 3 and by whom he was entirely forgotten!</p>\n<p><strong><em>May 9th, Saturday</em></strong><br/>\n        Hunt left before breakfast and Pink went off at lunch to join him at Elgon Club. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 10th</em></strong><br/>\n        No peace for the wicked.  At 12.30 the Fermins (our new Bank Manager) arrived.  He has the reputation of being \"difficult\" about overdrafts and is therefore called \"Vermin\" but they seemed pleasant amiable people and I hope went away feeling that we were safe to lend money to!  The child kept me in fits, a typically colonial little bratling, utterly uncontrolled and entirely disobedient.  They came in a brand new car looking more smart than anything I've ever seen and I'm sorry they did not see the Dodge as they would have realised then that we need an increase on our overdraft!  Good rain fell this evening. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 11th, Monday</em></strong><br/>\n        Today Capt House arrived to see to the electric light.  Day of days!  I really cant realise the amazement of this wonderful thing. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 12th</em></strong><br/>\n        Today the little engine is installed!  in its house in the kitchen yard!! More and more planting out and a good rain, all most satisfactory. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 13th, Wednesday</em></strong><br/>\n        A little more than a year ago I tentatively enquired of Pink when he thought we should be able to put the gangs on to the front garden and he replied \"Oh not till about June I fear\".  Well the top rose garden being now finished we started in on the main front yesterday and today I signed on four more totos and he put on two of his boys so I really feel as though we were getting a move on at last. </p>\n\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_3": {"order": 3, "title": "Viewer 3", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1931/may/Gears_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<p><strong>\"A sweet Advt.\", writes Wynne at the top of this - \"soon we shall no longer have to think at all\".</strong></p>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"496\">\n<tr>\n<td><img height=\"1179\" src=\"//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1931/may/Gears.jpg\" width=\"496\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_4": {"order": 4, "title": "Viewer 4", "excerpt": "\n\n\n\n\n<p>May 14th - 22nd</p>\n<p>Work on the lighting system continues...and the post boy is arrested, so no mail arrives.</p>\n\n", "description": "<td>\n\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>May 14th</em></strong><br/>\n        We finished setting up the batteries this morning so thats that.

Work progresses slow and sure and it is to be hoped that the Waterloo of lamps is in sight. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 15th</em></strong><br/>\n        We are reduced in number this evening.  Capt House has returned to Kitale for the weekend and Pink has gone to spend the same with the Morgans who are having a large \"do\".  All the morning we worked in and around the shrubbery, after lunch darned stockings by the millions and attacked the long border after tea. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 16th</em></strong><br/>\n        Dear Peter Shaw is with us today, a man of many parts, and I'd rather be his friend than his enemy.  A day of Saturday chores and mail day, my letters were from CMJ and Sir Henry Lawson, the latter in reply to mine about Lady Wilma who died this Spring.  Dear gracious lady, an outstanding personality and a real personification of the meaning of \"lady\".  How desperately \"left\" he must be. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 17th</em></strong><br/>\n        A day of leisure and the solving or rather attempt thereat of crossword puzzles.  Peter S is good at these. We are much amused at his often outspoken acidity, his caustic remarks and pessimism.  I cannot think that he and Upton can be a comfortable pair and yet they have stuck it since 1924, longer than most such arrangements.      </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 18th, Monday</em></strong><br/>\n        At 7 this evening we saw car lights coming up the shamba and thought it was Pink but to our amazement who should arrive but Charles de la Harpe and Swan his pupil!  The females looked at one another and said: food? and the girls rushed out and divided the puddings which was fruit in glasses.  Meat being patties sufficed.  Well they played Bridge and then after dinner more Bridge and eventually at 11.30 they went, Pink returning in the small hours was not seen this night. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 19th</em></strong><br/>\n        Capt House works on like an industrious ant all day and the electric light gradually gets nearer and nearer.  I simply cant realise it and I am busy making shades.  The front garden also progresses. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 20th</em></strong><br/>\n        What has happened to the Mail?  The post boy never returned today.  What has become of him I wonder, he who is always early and comes singing up the road.  Electric wiring creeping from room to room. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 21st</em></strong><br/>\n        Apparently the Police detained the post boy not on account of misdemeanours but a dilapidated <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kipande\">kipande</a>.   This day began and ended with the most wonderful sky effects I've ever seen.  The compete double rainbow and the amazing colouring in the clouds tonight really got me by the throat. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 22nd</em></strong><br/>\n        I went this morning up to Frank's place with Pink, he with a bag of shillings to pay the boys.  Armed with my work I sat under the trees and drank tea which a minute toto prepared and brought me whilst Pink went round the farm and afterwards did tickets. </p>\n\n\n</td>"}, "viewer_5": {"order": 5, "title": "Viewer 5", "featured_image": "//wynnesdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/1931/may/Doc1_small.jpg", "description": "<td>\n\n<p><strong>Wynne was fascinated by all the new developments taking place.

The sun streams through the open windows and one might almost be lying in the garden.  I read in \"The Golden Bough\", that tremendous tome, and once again am impressed that there is nothing new under the sun.  I have just finished also Maeterlink's book on the White Ant, most bogeyish but I refuse to bogeyed. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 25th</em></strong><br/>\n        I have to recount a horrid tragedy.  Our dear little cat was killed last night by apparently a Cerval Cat.  This beast two nights ago took a turkey mother and 10 of her brood, such a loss.  Tonight we are putting a poison bait down for him and shutting up the other two cats. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 26th</em></strong><br/>\n        A most terrific storm.  Capt House returned from Kitale.  We had hoped he was bringing lamps and shade frames but those fools in Nairobi had sent all he wrong thing and so a further delay must be endured, but he did bring the stores out and with much excitement and thrill we unpacked this now yearly joy.  It is a joy to a housekeeper's heart and my cupboard is now well stocked for another year. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 28th, Thursday</em></strong><br/>\n        Such rain and how we welcome it, we've had over 5 inches in 6 days! and the whole place looks lovely. </p>\n<p><strong><em>May 29th</em></strong><br/>\n        Oak Apple Day!

The reason for his visit viz, the refusal of the engine to start, was found to be that the turning handle had been put in the wrong way round! So all day long we have listened to the sound of its music and will have to do so until Thursday by which time it will have \"run in\".

June the month of Roses is once more upon us, for it is rose month out here as well as at Home.  A cloudless day and no rain again.  I do not wish to cavil but we are in the midst of planting coffee and this sudden cessation is a bit trying.  All day long our engine has been thrumming.
